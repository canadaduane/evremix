MANUSCRIPT  STORY.
INTRODUCTION
Near the west Bank of the Coneaught River there are the remains of an ancient fort. As I was walking and forming various conjectures respecting the character situation and numbers of those people who far exceeded the present race of Indians in works of art & inginuety I hapned to tread on a flat Stone. This was at a small distance from the fort: & it lay on the top of a small mound of Earth exactly horizontal— The face of it had a singular appearance I discovered a number of characters which appeared to me to be letters—but so much effaced by the ravages of time, that I could not read the inscription. With the assistance of a leaver I raised the Stone—But you may easily conjecture my astonishment when I discovered that its ends and sides rested on Stones  &  that it was designed  as  a cover to an artificial cave.—I found  on  examining that its Sides were lined with * * * built in a connical form with * * * down— &  that it was about eight feet deep—Determined to investigate the design of this extraordinary work of antiquity—I prepared myself with necessary requisites for that purpose and decended to the Bottom of the cave—Observing one side to be perpendicular
nearly three feet from the bottom, I began to inspect that part with accuracy; Here I noticed a big flat Stone fixed in the form of a doar, I immediately tore it down & Lo a cavity within the wall presented itself—it being about three feet in diameter from side to side and about two feet high Within this cavity I found an earthan Box with a cover which shut it perfectly tite—The Box was two feet in length one & half in breadth & one and three inches in diameter. My mind filled with awful sensations which crowded fast upon me would hardly permit my hands to remove this venerable deposit but curiosity soon gained the ascendancy & the box was taken & raised to open * * * When I had removed the cover I found  that it contained twenty eight  sheets  of parchment. & that when  ******  appeared to be manuscripts written in an eligant hand with Roman Letters & in the Latin Language
They were written on a variety of Subjects. But the Roll which principally attracted my attention contained a history of the authors life & that part of America which extends along^ the great Lakes & the waters of the Missisippy.
Extracts of the most interesting and important matters contined in this Roll I take the liberty to publish 
[Oentle Reader tread lightly on the allies of the venera^ble dead — Tfiou must know that this Country was once inhabited by great & powerful nations considerably civilized & skilled in the arts of war^ and that on ground where thou  now  treadest many [an hard foul ^ bloody Battle hath been faught — & heroes by the thousand \have bem]made to bite the dust
In the history given of these nations by my Author you wiU find nothing but what will correspond with the natural sentiments W3 should form on viewing the innumerable remains of Antiquity which are scaitered over an extensive Country. This is an evidence of the authors impartiality and veracity. But if any should pretend that the whole story is fi/^titiov^ or fabulous^
To publish a translation of every particular circumstance
mentioned by our author would produce a volume too expensive for the general class of readers. But should this attempt to throw off the vail which has secluded our view from the transactions of nations who, for ages have been extinct, meet the approbation of the public, I shall then be happy to gratify the more inquisitive  &  learned part of my readers by a more minute publication. Apprehensive that sceptical, illiberal or supersticious minds may censure this performance with great accrimony I have only to remark that they will be  deprived  of a great fund of entertainment  which those  of a contrary disposition will obtain. My compassion will be excited more than my resentment and there the contest will end.
Now Gentle Reader the Translator who wishes well to thy present  &  thy future existence entreats the to peruse this volume with a clear head a pure heart  &  a candid mind—If thou shalt that thy head & thy heart are both improved it will afford him more satisfaction than the approbation of ten thousand who have received no benefit. 
\_And now permit me to admonish thee that if thou shouldst reside in or travel thro' any part of the Country]
CHAPT   I
An Epitomy of  the  Authors life & of his arival in America  
As it is possible that in some future age this part of the Earth will be inhabited by Europians & a history of its present inhabitants will be a valuable acquisition I propose to write one & deposit it in a box secured * * * * so that the ravages of time will have effect upon it.   That you
may know the Author I will give a succint account of his life & of the cause of his arival—which I have extracted from a manuscript which will be deposited with this history:
\_My name was [is] Fabiv^]  The family name I sustain is Fabius, being decended from the illustrius General of that name—I was born at Rome and received my  [tuition] education under the tuition of a very learned Master—At the time that Constantino arived at that city & had overcome his enimies & was firmly seated on the throne of the Roman empire I was introduced to him as a young Gentleman  [litera]  genius & learning and as being worthy of the favourable notice of his imperial majisty—He gave me the appointment of one of his Secritaries, and such were the gracious intimations which he frequently gave me of his high approbation of my conduct that I was happy in my stations. One day he says to me—Fabius you must go to Brittain and carry an important * * * * ^o the general of our army there * * * * sail in a vessel and return when she returns Preparation was made instantly and we sailed—The vessel laden with provisions for the army— cloathing, knives and other impliments for their use had now arived near the coasts of Britan when a tremendous storm arose & drove us into the midst of the boundless Ocean. Soon the whole crew became lost  &  bewildered—They knew not the direction to the rising Sun or polar Star—for the heavens were covered with clouds;  &  darkness had spread her sable mantle over the face of the raging deep. Their minds were filled with consternation & dispair— [and wnaimously agreed that]  What could we do? How be extrecated from the insatiable jaws of a watry tomb. Then it was that we felt our absolute dependence on that Almighty & gracious Being who holds the winds and storms in his hands—From him alone could we expect deliverance. To him our most fervent desires ascended—prostrate & on bended nees we poured forth incessant supplications, & even Old Ocean appeared to sym-
•   THE
pathize in our distress by returning the echo of our vociforosr-cries & lamentations—After being driven five days with.' incridable velocity before the furious wind, the storm abated: in its violance—but still the wind blew strong in the same direction—Doubt whether the wind had not changed her point we gave the ship full sail  &  let her drive—On the sixth day after, the storm wholly subsided, the sun rose clear  &  the heavens once more appeard to smile—Inexpressible was the consternation of all the crew, they found themselves in the midst of a vast Ocean No prospect of returning—all was lost —The wind blowing westwardly & the presumption was that it had been blowing in that direction during the whole of the storm. No pen can paint the dolorious cries  &  lamentations of the poor mariners—for the loss of friends for the loss of every thing they held most dear. At length a Mariner stept/onward  in  the midst & proclaimed. Attend O friends & listen to my words—A voice from on high hath penetrated my soul  &  the inspiration of the Almighty hath bid me proclaim—Let your sails be wide spread and the gentle winds will soon waft you into a safe harbor—A country where you will find hospitality.—Quick as the lightnings flash, joy sparkled in every countenance—A Hymn of Thanksgiving . spontaniously bust forth from their lips—In full confidence that the divine prediction would be accomplished they extoled the loving-kindness and tender mercies of their God  &  promised, by the assistance of his grace to make ample returns of gratitude. On the fifth day after this we came  in  sight of Land—we entered a spacious River— &  continued sailing up the  same  many leages until we came in view of a Town— Every heart now palpitated with joy—& loud shouts of gladness expressed the enthusiastic transports of our souls. We anchored within a small distance from shore—Immediately the natives ran with apparent signs of surprise & astonishment, to the bank of the River—After viewing us for some time, and receiving signs of Friendship—they appeard to hold

a counsel for a few a few minutes—Their King then stept forward to the edge of the bank— &  proffered us the hand of friendship—& by significant gestures invited us to Land promising us protection & hospitality. We now found ourselves once more on terra firma—& were conducted by the King  & four cheifs into the town whilst the multitude followed after, shouting and peforming many odd jesticulations—The King ordered an entertainment to be prepared  for  his new friends which consisted of * * * * meat fish, boiled beans & samp ******* The whole was placed under a wide spreading Oak in wooden dishes—A large clam shell & a stone Knife were provided for each one The King then came forward with about twenty of his principal subjects— &  seated us, (being twenty in number) by the side of our repast—He and his company then took seats in front. After waving his hand & bowing all fell to eating and a more delicious repast we never enjoyed—The repast being finished our attention was called to a collection of about One thousand men and women who had formed a ring and invited our company to come for-' ward into the midst—after gazing upon us for some time with surprize we were permitted to withdraw and to take our stand in the Ring—About forty in number then walked into the midle of the Ring & began a song with such discordant and hedious modifications of sounds and such frantic jesticulations of  body, that it seemed that chaos had bro't her furies to set the world in an uproar—And an uproar it was in a short time for the whole company fell to shouting, & screaming, whooping, & screaming  [at entervals] —then dancing, jumping & tumbling with many indisdiscrible distortions in their countenance  & indelicate jestures—In fact they appeared more like a company of devils than human Beings. This lasted about one hour— They then took their places in a circle & at a signal given gave three most tremendous whoops; they then instantly dispersed* playing many an tike capers—& making such a confused medly of sound by skreaming, whooping screaching like owls,

Barking like dogs & wolvs & croaking like Bull frogs, that my brains seemed to be turned topse turvy—& for some time €ould scarce believe that they belonged to the human species.
CHAPT.   II
An f^count of the settlement of the Ships Company—[and  many particulars respecting the natives']
As no alternative now remained, but either to make the desparate attempt to return across the wide boistrous ocean or to take up our residence in a country inhabited by savages & wild ferocious beasts we did not long hesitate. We held a solem treaty with the king & all the chiefs of his nation.— They agreed to cede to us a tract of excellent Land on the north part of the town on which was six wigwams, & engaged perpetual amity & hospitality & the protection of our lives & property.—In consideration of this grant we gave them fifty yards of scarlet cloth & fifty knives; with this present they were highly pleased. 
Arrangements must now be made for  our  settlement. Vessel & cargo had  suffered  no material damage, & by striping the vessel of its plank we could erect a house in which we could deposite the whole cargo safety—All hands were immediatly employed some in procuring timber, which was hued on two sides & then locked together, some in procuring shingles & some in striping the vessel of its plank; & having a large quantity of nails on board, in ten days we finished a very convenient storehouse, sufficiently spacious to receive the whole cargo. We also built a  [smaUl  house adjoining which was to be the habitation of the Captain and myself—Having secured all our property we then found it necessary to estab-
lish some regulations for the goverment of our little society. —The Captain whose* name was Luian and myself were appointed judges in all matters of controversy  &  manages of thq public property, to make bargains with the natives  &  barter such articles as we did not need for necessaries.—As we all professed to believe in the religion of Jesus Christ we unanimously chose Trojanus the mate of the Ship, a pious good man, to be our minister, to lead our devotions morning & evening & on the Lords day.—
But now a most singular  &  delicate subject presented itself for consideration. Seven young women we ha& on board, as passengers, to visit certain friends they had in Britain—Three of them were ladies of rank, and the rest were healthy bucksom Lasses.—Whilst deliberarating on this subject a mariner arose whom we called droll Tom—Hark ye shipmates says he. Whilst tossed on the foming billows what brave son of neptune had any more regard for a woman than a sturgeon, but now we are all safely anchored on Terra firma— our sails furled  &  ship keeled up, I have a huge longing for some of those rosy dames—But willing to take my chance with my shipmates—I propose that they should make their choise of husbands. The plan was instantly adopted. As the choie fell on the young women they held a consultation on the subject. & in a short time made known the result—Droll Tom was rewarded for his benevolent proposal with one of the most sprightly rosy dames in the company.—Three other of the most cheerful resolute mariners were chosen by the other three buxhum Lasses—The three young Ladies  [of rankl  fixed their choise on the Captain the mate  &  myself.  [Happy indeed in my partner I had formed an high esteem for the excellent qi/jalities of her mind]  The young Lady who chose me for a partner was possessed of every attractive charm both of body &  mind—We united heart  &  hand with the fairest prospect of enjoying every delight & satisfaction which are attendant on the connubial State.   Thus ended the affair.    You may well
conceive our singular situation. The six poor fellows who were doomed to live in a state of Cebicy or accept of savage dames, discovered a little chagrine  &  anxeity—However they consoled themselves with the idea of living in families where they could enjoy the company of the fair sex  &  be releived from the work which belongs to the department of Women.— Our community might be said to be one family tho we lived in seperate houses, situate near each other. The property was common stock—what was produced by our labour was likewise to be common, all subject to the distribution of the judges who were to attend to each family & see that propper industry and econimy were practised by all.—-
The Capt.  &  myself, attended with our fair Partners & two mariners repaired to a new habitation which consisted of two convenient appartments. After having partook of an elligant Dinner & drank a bottle of excellent wine our spirits were exhilerated & the deep gloom whicli beclouded our minds evaporated. The Capt. assuming his wonted chearful-ness made the following address My sweet good soald fellows we have now commenced a new voige—Not such as brot us over mountain billows to this butt end of the world— No, no, our voyge is on dry land —  &  now we must take care that we have sufficient ballast for the riging—every hand on hoard this ship must clasp hands  &  condecend to each others humour, this will pro-good cheer and smooth the raging billows of life. Surrounded by innumerable hords of human beings, who resemble in manners the Ourang Outang—let us keep aloof from them  &  not embark in the same matrimonial ship  [with them] —At the same time we will treat them with good cheer— &  inlighten their dark souls with good instruction —By continuing a distinct people  &  preserving our customs manners, religion & arts and sciences another Italy will grow up in this wilderness  &  we shall be celebrated as the fathers of a great  &  happy nation.—May God bless your soul, says one of our mariners, what would you have us do who have had the
woful luck not to get mates to cheer our poor souls  &  warm our bodies, methinks I could pick out a healthy plum Lass from the copper coulered tribe that by washing and scrubing her fore & aft  &  upon the labbord  &  stabbord sides she would become a wholsome bedfellow—& I think may it please your honour I could gradually pump my notions into her head & make her a good shipmat for the cupboard & as good hearted a christian as any of your white damsels.—& upon my soul— I warrant you if we have children, by feeding them with good fare  &  keeping them clean they will be as plump  &  as fair  & nearly as white as your honors children.—Upon this I filled the bottle with wine & observing to honest Crito that he was at liberty j,o make the experiment if he could find a f^ir * * * * to his liking—I then expressed the great pleasure I received from the addresses of the speakers. &  drank success ^o the new voige—All drank plentifully & the exhileration produced the greatest qheerfulness & hilarity.—By this time the sun had hid his head below the horizon & darkness invited all the animal creation to sleep  & rest.   We retired two & two hand in hand —Ladies heads little
awri—blushing like the morn  &  But I forgot to mention
that our society passed a resolution to build a church in the midst of our village.

Many particulars respecting the Natives
Intrest as well as curiosity invited an acquaintance with our new neighbours—They were called in their language Deliwares. They were tall—bodies well proportioned, strait limbs, complections of a brownish hue—broad cheek bones, black wild roling eyes,—& hair black  &  course.   To strangers
they were hospitable—true to their engagements, ardent in their friendship, but to enemies implacable cruel & barbarous in the extreme.—Innumerable hords of this dis-cription of people were scattered over an extensive country, who gained their living by hunting the elk, the dear  &  a great variety of other wild animals—by fishing  &  fowling & by raising corn, beans & squashes.—Shooting the arrow slinging stones, wrestling, jumping, hoping  &  runing were their principal amusements—& prizes would often be staked as a reward to the conqueror.—Their cloathing consisted of skins dressed with the hair on—^but in warm weather, only the middle part of their bodies were incumbered with any covering—The one , half of the head of the men was shaved & painted with red— & the one half of the face was painted with black. The head was adorned with feathers of various kinds—& their ears & noses were ornimented with rings, formed from the sinues of certain animals, on which were suspended smooth stones of different coulars. Thus cloathed, thus painted, thus ornimented the  Deliwares made a most terrefic  appearance —They held festivals at stated times, which varied in the manner of conducting them, according to the object they had in view—At one of their annual festivals their cerimonies were peculiarly singular & different from any that were ever practised by any nation—Here a description would give us some idea of their religion & would gratify the curiosity of an ingenious mind.
When the time arives—which is in September, the whole tribe assemble—They are dressed & ornimented in the higest fashion—The women in particular have their garments & heads so adorned with feathers shells & wampum that they make a very brilliant & grotesque appearance.— — They form a circle—their countinances are solemn. A Speaker mounts a stage in the midst. At this moment two Black Dogs led by two Boys—& two White Dogs led by two young damsels enter the circle and are tied  together  The Speaker then extended his hands & spoke   Hail ye favorite children of the great & good
Spirit, who resides in the Sun, who is the father of all living creatures & whose arms incircle us all around—who defends us from the malicious designs of that great malignant Spirit that pours upon us all the evils we endure he gives us all our meat  &  our fish— &  causes the corn  &  the fruits to spring up & makes us to rejoice in his goodness. He hath prepared a delightful country to receive us—if we are valiant in battle or are benevolent & good—There we can pick all kinds of delicious fruit  &  have game  &  fish in abundance & our women being improved in beuty & sprighliness will cause our hearts to dance with delight—But wo unto you wicked, , malicious, mischevous mortals—your lot will be cast in a dark mirey swamp—where the malignant Spirit will torment you with musquetoes  &  serpents  &  will give you nothing to eat but toads, frogs & snails.—But 0 my dear friends—^all hail— here is a custom which is sanctioned by time immemorial —Look steadfastly on the black dogs  &  let not your eyes be turned away—when they are thrown on the sacred pile & the flames are furiously consuming their bodies—then let your earnest prayers asseud for pardon  &  your transgressions will flee away like shadows & your sins will be carried by the smoke into the shadows of oblivion—When this solemn expa-tory sacrifice is ended then prepare your souls to partake of the holy festival—Each one will receive a precious morsel from thesB immaculate snow coulered Dogs in token that your offences have all evaporated in the smoke of the holy sacrifice,  &  that you are thankful to the benevolent Spirit for the abundance of good things that you enjoy—& that you humbly anticipate the continuance of his blessings & that he will defend you against the evil designs of that malignant Spirit, who gives us gawl & wormwood,  &  fills our bosoms with pain & our eyes with tears. He then proclaimed, let the sacred pile be erected & the solemn sacrifice performed. Instantly about one hundred men came forward with small dry wood & bundles of dry sticks & having thrown them in
one pile within the circle—they sat the pile on fire—The black dogs were knocked on the head & thrown on the top—in a moment all was in a blaze  &  the flame assended in curls to heaven. The whole company assumed the most devout attitude & mutteued in sounds almost inarticulate their humble confessions & ernest requests—
When the dogs were consumed & the fire nearly extinguished, the cerimonies of their sacred festival began—the white dogs which were v«ry plump & fat, were knocked on the head & their throats cut. Their hair was then singed off, having first their entrails taken out—& being suspended by the nose before a hot fire they were soon roasted—thrown upon a long Table  &  desected into as many pieces as there were persons to swallow them—The company immediately formed a procession, one rank of "men, the other of women— the men marching to the left & the women to the right of the Table each one  took  a piece  &  devoured it with as good a * * * * as if it had been the most delicious morsel. Having completed these sacred cerimonies with great solemnity—Jhe whole company formed themselves into a compact circle round the stage—ten musitians immediately mounted & at once, the multitude on every side sang a song—The tune & the musical voices of the singers pleased the ear, whilst the immagination was delighted with the poetic inginuety of the composition—The multitude all joined .in the chorus, with voices so loud & 'multifarious that the atmosphere quaked with terror—& the woods and neighboring hills  [sent back']  by way of mockery—sent back the sound of their voices improved by tenfold confusions. Perhaps, reader, you have the curiosity to hear the song—I can give you only the last stanzy & the chorus. -
' For ua tbe'sun emits his rais
*  The moon shines forth for our delight ' The stars extol our heroes prais
*  And warriors flee before our fight.
CHORUS
' Delawan to chakee poloo ' ^lan^ango &rwah teloo
*  Chanepaah, lawango chapah
*  Quinebogan bamboo gowah.
The solemnities are ended  &  in their opinion their poor souls are compleatly whitewashed— &  every stain entirely effaced. A little  diversion  will now dissipate the solemnity & inspire them with cheerfulness & merriment.
The whole tribe repair to the top of an hill, at one place their is a gradual slope a small distance  &  then it decends about twenty five feet in an almost perpendicular direction, at the bottom of which is a quagmire, which is about ten feet in length & the soft mud is about three feet deep—at each end the ground is soft but not miry—Down this declivity twenty pair of very suple  &  sprightly young men  &  women are to decend, If by their agility & dexterity they escape the (juagmire—a piece of wampum will be the reward of each fortunate champion—^but if they plunge in, their, their recom-pence will be the ridecule  &  laughter of the multitude
In making this decent, six young women & five young men by a surprising dexterity in whirling their bodies as they decended cleared themselves from the quagmire—The rest as their turns came plunged in & came out most wofuUy muded to the great diversion of the spectators. The incident which excited the most merriment hapned when the last  party decended.% by an unlucky spring to clear himself from the quagmire he bro't his body along side of the declevity & roled his whole length into the midst of the quagmire where he lay [to  whole length in an horizontal position on his back^ —neither heels up or head up, but horizontally—soft & easy—but alas when one unlucky event happens another follows close on the heals.—the fair,  Iplump']  corpulent Damsel^ his affectionate sweetheart came instantly, sliding with great velocity—She saw the woful position of her beloved—She wished him no harm
—She raised her feet this bro't the center of gravity directly over the center of his head—here she rested a moment—his head sunk—she sunk after him his heels kicked against the wind like leshuran waked fat—but not a word from his lips— but his ideas came in quick succession—tho't he, what a disgrace to die here in the mud under the pressure of my sweet heart—^howeVer his time for such reflections, were short— the tender hearted maid collecting all her agility in one effort dismounted and found herself on dry land in an instant—not a moment to be lost; she seized her lover by one leg & draged him from the mud—a curious figure, extending about six feet six inches on the ground,—all bismeared from head to foot, spiting,—puffing, panting  &  strugling for breath—Poor man. the whole multitude laughing at thy calamity, shouting, rediculing—none to give thee consolation but thy loving & simpithetec partner  [in misfortune —  l^on my soul, eocclaiTns droll Tom — stemfermost — that bouncing Lass ought to have the highest prize for dragging her ship from the mud] —^She was cleaning the filth from his face. —
CHAP   IV.
A journey to the N W.  &  [removcU.]
Gracious God! how deplorable our situation! are we doomed to dwell among hords of savages—& be deprived of all social intercourse with friends  &  the civilized world? & what will be the situation of bur offspring? will they preserve our customs  &  manners, cultivate the arts  &  sciences  &  maintain our holy religion or  [rather']  will they not rather degenerate into savages  &  by mingling with them become the most * * *. * * race of beings in existence—Who can indure such reflections, such heart-rending anticipations?—they pour
upon my soiU like a flood and bear me down with the weight of • a milstone. 0 that my head were waters & my eyes a fountain of tears—then my intolerable btirthen should be poured forth in a torrent & my soul set at liberty. But behold the light springs up & beams upon my soul. She brings in her train Hope—that celestial Godes, that sure & strong anchor—that dispencer of comfort & pleasing anticipation—& that dispeller of coroding grief & black dispair—She bids me review the exploded reasning of a great philosopher & compair it with my own observations—perhaps the result will point out a safe road to the land of our nativity.
Thus I reasoned respecting the solar system, of which the earth is a part. Provided the earth is stationary, according to the present system of philosophy—then the sun, the moon & the plannets, being at an immense distance from the earth—must perform their revolutions round her with inceivable velocity— whereas, if according to the Platonic system, the earth is a globe—& the sun is stationary then the earth by a moderate velocity  can  perform her revolutions—This scheme will represent the solar system as displaying the transcendant wisdom of its almighty Architect—for in this, we behold the Sun suspended by omnipotence & all the planents moving round him as their common center in exact order & harmony—In this we can easily account for days & nights & the different seasons of the year,—When the earth presents one part of her face to the sun it is day—When that part is turned from his beams it is night—When she varies to the south the sun shines upon us in a more perpendicular direction—the suns beams become more dence & the heat increases—as she returns back the heat decreases in proportion as this part of ea,rth looses its perpendicular direction to the sun & the cold becomes more intence in the same proportion.—This accounts for the various seasons of the year, appears correct and consistent & highly honourable to the divine perfections.
\^But behold the other system — The Earth firmly fixed on a
firm foundation—perhaps as some on a giards hack wlio stands on a prodigious Rock — Its surjice widely extended nearly horizontal — \& its cut dovm\ & its sides cut down strait or perpe7idicular to the very bottom — below which is a bottomless abiss Pray Mr, Philosopher what man was ever there amd looked down? & what prevents the Ocean, unless it is damd with earth & rocks from pouring down 4c loosing itself in this horrible ahissf — But how extensive is this teraque-surface? Indeed I am of opinion, if this sistem is true I am nearly at one end of it. But the hipothises is too absurd & inconsistent. The earth must be of a spherical form & a westerly course will lead us to the land of our nativity — Perhaps this is a part of the eastern Continent^ or perhaps only a narrow strip of the Ocean intervenes? On no other principle can toe account for the emigration of the ancestors of those innumerable hords of human beings thai possess this continent — Their tradition is thai their ancestors came form the west — & they agree in their information that at the distance of fifteen days journey in a westerly direction, there are nations vastly more numerous, powerful & civilized than themselves,}
The earth therefore must be a globe and a westerly courae will lead us to the land of our nativity. On what principle can we account for the emigration of the ancestors of these innumerable hords of human beings that possess this Continent? Their tradition tells them that they emigrated from the westward—From this I draw the conclusion—that the sea if any, which intervenes between the two Continents at the westward is not so extensive, but that it may be safely navigated.  II have also learnt from some of the']  we are also informed by some of the natives, that at the distance of about fifteen days journey in a northwesterly course there is a great River which runs in a  ^south']  westerly direction,  [they cannot tell how far] —& that along the banks of this river there are great towns & mighty kings & a people who live in a state of civilization— From all these considerations I am determined to remove— pursue a westerly course & seek the delightful country of my
3
ancestors.—Imediately I communicated my determination & the reasons on which it was founded to our little Society, who joyfully acquiessed—It was tho't to be the most prudential to find out the disposition & character of the inhabitants, who were settled along the great River lest we should fall into the hands of Robbers—For this purpose my man Crito & mysell & a Delawan for an interpreter set off. We passed thro' a a country interspersed with vilages, inhabited by the same kind of people as the Delawans until we came to a great mountain. Having passed over this we had not traveled far before we came to the confluence of two great Rivers which in conjunction produced a river which was called Owaho deep enough^ for the navigation of Ships.—Here was a large town or city inhabited by a distinct race of people from any we had seen before. We were immediately conducted to the King & were received very graciously—& having asked a number of very pertinent questions & received answers to his satisfaction—I then made known to him our business & had all my requests granted—As we proposed to move into his territory he offered to furnish us for our convenience with four Mammoons & four men to manage them. These were an annimal of prodigious magnitude, even biger than the eliphant, which the natives had tamed & domesticated—They were very segacious & docile & were employed in carying burthens & in drawing timber— [& in plowing their land] —Their hair at the spring season was about seven inches iii length & was of a fine wooly consistence—& being sheared off at the proper season was manufactured into course Cloth—and the milk of the females, which they produced in abundance, afforded a very wholsome nutriment. Having thus succeeded beyond our expectation we made as much expidition to return as possible —^We arrived in safety without any material accidents—The Little Society I had left were greatly rejoised on our returne— & highly pleased with the account we gave of the country we had visited— &  at the sight of those  [extraordinary ^prodigious
animals']  mammoons which we had bro't to convey our baggage. —No time was lost to make preparation for the journey—The Captain, Mate & myself went to the King & held a conference with him & the cheifs & obtained leave to depart, tho with apparent regret & reluctance. Sacks were provided from Course Cloth to receive the most valuable part of our goods & furniture—These were thrown across three of the Mammoons —The other was caparisoned, in a manner too tedious to discribe for the accomidation of our women & children— They were all mounted upon him & road with great convenience  &  safety.  [Being thvs prepared & ready]  Thus having resided among the Delivans two years—& being prepared to take our departure The King & his chiefs & many of his principal subjects came forward to take an affectionate farewell. This was done on both sides, with mutual expressions of the most ardent and sincere Friendship & the most earnest wishes. & prayers for future prosperity and happiness Having takea our final adieu I observed honest Crito sheding tears very^ plentifully—You seem to be affected said I—God bless your honour said, he, when I think how kind & generous these poor Delawans have been to us I cannot help feeling an affection & friendship for them—We were obliged to anchor amongst them —we were strangers—& helpless and they were ignorant Savages—yet they held out the hand of kindness & treated us as brothers & sisters.—Have they not fdflfiUed the law of Christian charity—0 that'they were good Christians—may God forgive their ignorance & unbeleife—and reward them for their kindness & gerosity.—We passed on—No obsticles impeded our journey until we came to the great River Suscowah—which runs between the Deliwah River and the great mountain—The water being too deep for fording, we built a small boat and with this, at several times we conveyed the whole of the baggage & Company across, except the manager of the Mammoons, who mounted them & swam them across—We then proceeded on by slow marches,—but in crossing the great
mountain we had some difficulties to encounter  [but hower met with received no maierial damage] —^but finally arived safely at the great city Owhahon on the twenty fifth day after our departure from the Deliwan.
Fatigued with a long and difficult journey, great joy and gladness were visible in every Countenance, and all were disposed to establish our residence here until further information could be obtained & further measures concerted to prosecute our journey to Europe The King and his principal officers proffered us every assistance necessary to make our situation agreeable. They assigned us in  [conformity to our wishes]  compliance with our request, a number of houses on the bank of the river at a little distance from the City—We made him some valuable presents in return, which he received as a token of friendship but not as a compensation^—For such was the high sence of honour which this prince sustained, that when he made a present, he would take it as an insult to offer him any thing as a compensation.—
Having now once more become setled our little community continued the same regulations which they had established at Deliwan—& all things proceeded in peace & our affairs prospered. 
CHAP   V
A discription of the Ohons, [<fe  manner of procuring a living,]
I am now to discribe a  [species of]  nation who have but little resemblance to those  [innumerable tribes of]  Savages, who live along the coasts of the Atlantic—Their complexion, the form and construction of their bodies, their customs manners. Laws, government  &  religion all demonstrate that they must
have originated from some other nation  &  have but a very-distant affinity with their Savage neighbours.—As to their persons, they were taller on an average than I had ever seen in any nation—their bones wer large, limbs strait  &  shoulders broad—iTheir eyes rather small & sunck deep in the head Their forheads were prominant—& the face below tapering in such a manner that the chin was forned nearly to a point. As to their complexion, it was hording on an olive tho of a lighter shade—Their eyes were generally of a dark brown or black Their hair of the same colour, tho I have sometimes seen persons, whose hair was of a redish hue.—
They cloathed themselves in cloth which was manufactured  [^among themselves]  from the hair of the Mammoons & from Cotton which was transported from the South westwest-ward. The men wore shoes and long stockings,—wide trousses —a waistcoat & a garment with wide short sleaves which came down to their nees & in cold weather a Cloak over the whole The covering for the head was generaly a kind of a Cap which ran up high and tapered to a point—This was generally made of fur skins & was ornimented with feathers. It had a small brim in the shape of an half moon to project over the forehead—
The women beside a stockings & shoes wore a short pete-coat a shirt of cotton a loose garment with sleaves which they girted round them with belts—& a cloak—They had various orniments such as ribbons made from cotton & coulored with different coulars—the most beautiful feathers that could be obtained and shels of various kinds—Indeed the higher class of women were extreemly fond of ornament— &  placed a large share of their happiness in the bliancy & gaudy appearance of their garments. The people obtained their living generally by the cultivation of the Land—&  [the manage']  by tending ancT managing certain animals which had been so long domesticated that they had lost their wild nature & become tame
Corn^ wheat, beans squashes & carrots they raised in great
abundance—The ground was plowed by horses & generally made very mellow for the reception of the seed.—
It was the occupation of a certain part of the men to tend upon the tame animals to drive them to pasture & keep them from straying and feed them when the snow was on the ground.—Two men would tend twenty Mammouth, which were indifferent whether they fed on grass or cropt the bushes— when these animals were fat^ their flesh was highly esteemed— They had droves of Elk, which they had so'tamed and tutored that they could manage them as they pleased—and they would follow them like a flock of sheep—& it was but seldom that any would leave their companions,—The elk constituted a considerable part of their animal food—The horses were managed in the same way—& the people tho't their meat to be a savory, dish.
They had large numbers of turkeys and gees—which tho originally wild yet by treating them with great familiarity by croping their wings and feeding them frequently they discovered no disposition to ramble off but propagated their species & laid eggs in abundance.—
Hunting  &  fishing were the employments of some—others followed mechanical business-H>thers carried on a bartering trade to the south westward—in order to furnish the people with cotton & other articles whose production was not con-ginial to their climate. By pursuing these various employments they generally had a plenty of provisions at all seasons & were comfortably cloathed.—And here I would remark as one striking characteristic of this people—that they observed great neatness in their dress—^in their cookery and in their houses.
The manufacturing of Iron & lead was understood but was not carried on to that extent & perfection as in Europe. A small quantity of Iron in proportion to the number of inhabitants served to supply them with all the impliments which custom had made necessary for their use—By hamnering  &
hardening their Iron they would convert it nearly into the consistence of steal— &  fit it for the purpose of edge tools.
The potery Business was conducted with great inginuity, & great quantities of stone and earthan ware consisting of  [every . kind]  of vessels of every construction which were needed for family use, were manufactured in every part of this extensive <X)untry. These vessels they ornimented with  [pictures wUK] the likenesses of various kinds of animals & trees & impressed upon them such coulors as would strike the fancy with delight. —The females of the  [higher Class]  most wealthy class would often have a large and superfluous quantity of this brittle furniture to decorate one apartment of the house—The vessels they arranged in such order a-s to make a display of taste & impress the mind with the agreeable sensation of beauty.—
In architecture there can be no comparison with the civilised nations of Europe—In their most welthy & popolous Cities their houses and public buildings, exhibit no eligance— no appearans of wealth & grandure—^all is plain—& nothing superfluous—^but convenience appears to be the whole object they had in view in the construction of their buildings of every kind.
Their houses were generally but one story high—^built of wood, being framed  &  covered with split clapboards or shingles <fe in the inside the walls were formed of clay, which, was plastered over with a thin coat of lime—Their houses seldom consisted of more than three appartments As to their chimnies, they construt a wall of stone about five feet hight  [for the fire to be]  against which they build their fire—from the top of this wall they construct their chimney with thin peices of split timber on the inside  [mith wet dirt or clay]  of which they plaister wet, dirt or clay-^which compleatly covers & adheres to the timber & prevents the fire from having any operation upon it. The inside of their houses, as the women generally practiss neetness makes a much better appearance than the outside.
It is my opinion, says Trojanus that this people display a
taste in building which is formed upon the true principles of
Reason—Their houses are sufficiently spacious for convenience
No expence or labour are thrown away in building useless
apartments—or in the erecting their houses higher than what
convenience   requires—The   whole   catalogue   of   ornimen-
tal trumpery   is   neglected—This in Room   produces   more
than half the   labour    &  expence in   buildings—[Fes    says
Ludan — &   without   thisy these   labowring   people   must  starve
for the  want of   employment,   & the citizens of the   Roman
empire .would  be  deprived   of  the   honour   of   possessing   a
splendid Capital &  of  the exquisite pleasure of beholding the
greatest exhibition of human   inginuity   in   the   eligancey  \the\
splendor \the\ simitry &' beauty of their houses, [theirl polices
& pvMic edifices — Triie indeed, replies  Trojanus, men may be
daded & delighted with such objects for a moment^—But could
not wealth be better bestowed [upon'\ to promote the intrest of the
community   & for   charitable purposes — &   these   artists better
employ their strength & inginuity in producing some substantial
benefits to themselves & others, — Rejoins Imcian, the cov/rse reason
dictates is to avoid extremes. — A slab coloured world would tire the
sences by its uniformity & too much orniment & splendor would cease
to please by its frequency.'\ —Besides—lofty houses can more easily
be overthrown by tornadoes or tumbled down upon our heads
by earthquakes.—The course says Lucian, that reason dictates
is to avoid extremes.   A slab coloured,  [wovtd]  by its uniformity
would tire the sences—& by its possessing too much orninent
& splendor it would cease to please.—
CHAR   VI
Disoription of the Learning—[jRcK^ion  dt eustOTM of the Ohons}
Learning appears to be so consonant to the nature of man  & [a good]  convenent share of it so easy to obtain, that some may wonder why it is not universally defused thro the
world;*  [But}  If we can place any reliance on the dark annals of antient history, it is a certain fact that Letters are indebted for their existence to the inventive genius of certain extraordinary characters—Egypt & Chaldea contended for the honour of being the firstf who invented letters—Perhaps they were invented in each nation nearly at the same time— [But]  let this be as it may—could no other nation in the world produce as great geniuses as Egypt or Chaldea? Is there any natural obsticle to prevent their prodution in America as well as in Asia?—^Whatever may be the Teasonings of some on this subject, the fact is, that I found  [Letters or]  some share of learning, tho' in a very imperfect state, among this people—At present I shall wave the account of its introduction & shall merely discribe the state of learning as it existed among the Ohons They had characters which represent words^& all compound words had each part represented by its apropriate character. The variation of cases moods  &  tenses was designated by certain marks placed under the character. They generally wrote on parchment— &  beginning at the right wrote from the top to the botton, placing each character directly under the preceding one—& having finished one colum or line they [begin the]  wrote the next on the left of that & so continue oil until they cover the parchment if the subject require it. in a work of considerable Labour & time to obtain such a knowledge of their characters & the application as to be able to read with fluency & to write with ease  &  accuracy—
In their principal Cities <fe towns the Government appoint learned men to instruct the sons of the higher class of citizens & in the course of four or five years they will make such proficiency as to become tolerable schoUars.
* But the wonder would cease when it is considered that mankind with but few exceptions to walk in the tracts of their fathers <fc pursue the road marked out by their education.   *
t Tho the most probable conjecture is that they were communicated from one nation to the other.
The works of the learned are not very voluminous. Records are kept of the transactions of their government. Their constitution  &  laws are committed to writing— \_A sacred Roll in in manuscript is preserved among the Records of their Emperors & kings']  <fe are dispersed thro the impire—& much pains is taken to defuse the knowledge of them among the people—In all their large towns & cities they have deposited under the care of a priest a sacred Roll, which contains the tenets of their Theology & a discription of their religious cerimonies. This order of men publish comments upon these sacred writings—they publish some tracks on moral philosophy—& some containing a collection of proverbs & the wise sayings of their sages.—
But the kind of composition in which they most excel is poetry—In poetic numbers they describe the great events, which take place—& the exploits and mighty atcheivments of their heroes—In soft eligies they paint the amours of Lovers &  in pathetic strains they delineate the calamimities & sorrows of the unfortunate. In their assemblies it is very common for a certain class of the Learned to entertain the company with a repetition of poetic peices describing the battles and exploits of their warriors—Or to sing some amarous or witty ballad— As for Theators they have none—but as a kind of substitute —^there are actors, who entertain the people by pronounsing dialogues or plays, in which they display all the arts of mimicry—&  [act out the]  express in their countenance their gesture & the tone of their voices different passions of the human mind As only a small proportion of the people are instructed in the arts of reading & writing, of consequen the great mass, must possess a large share of ignorance—^but not so great a share as savages who have no learning among them—They head the conversation & the letures of their sages— [they are entertained with]  Their poetic orators entertain them with the productions of their poets, containing the history of great events  &  mighty atcheivments—Their actors divert and please them by exciting
the various passions— [at the same time communicating instruction & corecting the natural savageness of maners  ftj/.] & as the peices they reherse contain many ideas & sentiments tending to expose the deformity of vice, the folly of superstition & the disgustfiilness of rude & clownish manners, the people of consequence are improved  &  considerably refined—add to this their living in compact towns or cities in which there is a constant and reciprocol communication of ideas—which of course would have no small effect to inform their minds—To all these causes combined the  [Ohons]  the grefat mass of the people are indebted for possessing a considerable share of knowledge and civilization.
RELION.   Vn.
In every nation there is some kind of Relion. & in every religion, however adulterated & corrupted there are some things which are commendable—some things which serve to improve the morals— &  influence mankind to conduct better than what they would do, provided they pursued the natural dictates of their depraved minds,  [without any restraint']  As this sentiment is an established maxim, which has been believed in every nation from the earliest ages  [of time in every nation,]  hence it has been the policy of all governments to encourage & protect some kind of Religion  &  precepts In examining the religious sentiments which are believed and practised thro'out this extensive emj)ire & which are encouraged &'protected by the government.—I found some things which are common to the various sistems of Theology in Europe  &  Asia  &  some things which have no resemblance to either. From the sacred Roll as it is denominated I shall extract the tenets of their Theology & a description of their
religious cerimonies. It expresses them to this effect. "There is an intelligent omnipotent Being, who is self existant  & infinitely good & benevolent—Matter eternally existed—He put forth his hand  &  formed it into such bodies as he pleased —He presides over the universe & has a perfect knowledge of all things—From his Qwn spiritual substance he formed seven sons—These are his principal agents to manage the. affairs of his empire—He formed the bodies of men from matter—Into each body he infused a particle of his own spiritual substance, in consequence of which man in his first formation was inclined to benevolence & goodness. There is also another great inteligent Being who is self existent & possessed of great power but not of Omnipotence—He is filled with infinite malice against the good Being & exerts all his subtlety & pow to ruin* his works—Seeing the happy situation of man he approached so near as to touch his soul with his deliterious hand —The poison was immediately defused  &  contaminated his passions  &  appetites—His reason and understanding received no injury—The good being looking upon his unhappy ofspring with infinite love and compassion made a decree that if mankind would reduce their passions & appetites under the government of reason he should enjoy blessings in this world & be compleatly happy after his soul quits hig body. Death . desolves the connection—Etherial Bodies are prepared for the souls of the righteous—These bodies can pass thro' any part of the universe  &  are invisable to mortal eyes. Their place of residence is on a vast plain which is beautified with magnificent Buildings—^with Trees, fruits  &  flowers.  [Here they enjoy every delight which']  No immagination can paint the delights, the felicity of the Righteous. But the wicked are denied etherial bodies—Their souls naked and incapable of^seeing light, dwel in darkness  &  are tormented with the keenest anguish—Ages roll away & the good being has compassion upon them—He permits them to take possession of etherial bodies and they arise quick to the abodes of delight & glory:
Now 0 man attend to thy duty  &  thou shalt escape the portion of  the wicked  &  enjoy  the delights of the righteous Avoid all acts of cruelty to man and beast* defraud not thy neighbour, nor suffer thy hands secretly to convey his property from him—Preserve thy body from the contamination of lust — &  remember the seduction of thy neighbors wife would be a great Crime—[ie^  thy citizens be numbered once in two years — & if the young womenj who are fit for marriage are more numerous than the young men — then wealthy men, who are young & who have but one wife, shall have the privHedge,  [with the permission of the King'l to marry another until the numbers of the single young men ^ the single young women are made equal   But he who hath two wives shall have a\ouse provided foi* each — ^ he shall spend his time equally with each one] —Be grateful for all favours & forsake not thy friend in adversity.   Treat with kindness  &  reverence thy Parents—Forsake them not in old age, nor let their cheeks be furrowed with tears for the want of bread.—Bow down thy head  before the aged, treat thy superiors with respect— & place thy rulers <fe thy teachers in the most honorable seats.   Let rulers consult the welfare of the people and not agrandize themselves by oppression  &  base bribes—Let Religious Teachers walk in the Road which leads to celestial happiness & lead the people after   them—Let Parents restrain the vices of their children & instruct their minds in useful knowledge—Contention and strife is the Bane of Families & the destruction of domestic happiness—^being yoked together the husband and wife ought to draw in the same direction—^their countenances will then  [appear beautiful'] shine with the effulgent Beams of Friendship & love—peace & harmony will attend their habitation & their affairs will prosper.
Hold out the hand of kindness & friendship to thy neighbour—consider him when reduced to indigence & distress—he
» No crime is so horrid as maliciously to destroy the life of man
is as dear to the great and good being as what thou art [&  now thou hast an opportunity to manifest the disposition of thy heart] To afford him relief will be pleasing to thy maker & an expression of thy gratituge Envious & malicious souls are almost incurably contaminated with that hellish poison which first disordered the soul of man—partake not of their guilt by joining them in the malignant work of slander  &  detraction. Their intended mischief returns upon their own heads & the slandered character of the innocent & just shines forth with increasing lusture. Let the stranger find a[n  hospitable']  resting place under thy Roof—^give him to eat from thy portion, that when he departs he m*ay bless thee & go on his way rejoicing.—
Say not to thyself I will indulge inactivity & idleness  & lie upon the bed of sloth & slumber away the precious moments of time—for in this thou art unwise—for disease will attend thee, hunger will torment thee—& Rags will be thy clothing—Let industry & econemy fill up the measure of thy waking moments, so shall thy countenance display health & sprightliness plenty shall supply the wants of thy family & thy reputation shall be respectable.
l^But I behold a being in human formy from whom I turn away with disgust & abhorrance He is covtred with so much dirt Scfiith, fhat no etherial body is provided for him no^* can he be received into the abodes of the blessed.]
Sufer not tliy bodies or thy garments to remain bismered with dirt & filth—Cleanliness prevents many deceases & is pleasant to the sight But from a dirty filthy mortal we turn with disgust  &  abhorrance As the great author of our existence is benevolent to all his offspring so it becomes us to be benevolent to our fellow beings around us—Our country is one Body & we are part of its members—^We are therefore bound to'maintain the rights  &  priviledges & the honour  &  dignity of our country at the Risk of our lives—Great rewards attend the Brave— &  their expploits & atchievments in contending
against tyrants & in defending the Rights of their country will be celebrated on the plains of story.—
But the vision now expands & directs our contemplation to fix on his attributes, whose spiritual substance is commensurate with infinity—As only a single particle from his substance constitutes our souls, how small, how diminitive must we appear in the view of Onnicxence—We must therefore contemplate his attributes thro the medium of his works—& admire with profound reverance & adoration his wisdom goodness  &  power which are visible in the formation  &  arrangement of all materiall bodies & spiritual beings. He requires us to suplicate his favours—& when received to express our gratitude—As our passions & appetites often get the assend-ence of reason-^we are therefore bound to confess our faults &  implore forgiveness—
Now that you know  &  keep all these things which were made known by divine inspiration, it is ordained that on every eighth day ye lay asside all unnecessary labour—that ye meet in convenient numbers & form assemblies That in each assembly a learned holy man shall preside, who shall lead your devotion, & explain this sacred Roll & give you such instruction as shall promote your happiness in this life  & in the life to come Once in three months—^ye shall hold a great festival in every city & towns & your priests shall sacrifice an Elk as a token that your sins deserve punishment—-but that the divine mercy has banished them into shades of forgetfulness.^—
Be attentive 0 man to the words of truth which have been recorded & pay respect to all the commandments which have been written for your observance—Your maker will then be pleased to see you rejoice in the participation of his favours & to behold your faces brighten with the benign beams of cheerfulness.—
4JV'  ACCOUNT OF BASKA.   [OHAF]   VIII
Among the great & ithistrious characters who have appeard m the world in different ages as instructors & reformers of mankind Baska is entitled to a conspicuous place — The place of his nativity is not recorded.  But the first notice which is given of him is —his appearance at the great city of Tolanga, which is situate on the Banks of the Siota River. He was attended by his wife & two little sons. The fashion of their garments were different from the natives—Their complexion likewise was a little whiter—Baska was grave solemn and sedate—^reserved in his conversation—^but when he spoke wisdom proceded from his lips —& all were astonished at his eloquence—His fame spread rapidly thro, cily & country—& he was celibrated as a man of the most briliant  &  extraordinary Talents.—He was conducted to the King & introduced to him—The King asked him from what country he came—His reply was at a great distance from the westward—He then asked him induced him to come into his country—He replied
CAPT vin
Perhaps Reader before we describe the government of the Ohons it might be proper to relax our minds with a few seeches of Biography—The character which will best connect with the history of the learning, rereligion & government of the Ohons is that of the great & illustrious Lobaska—He is the man, who first introduced their present method of writing, who first presented them the sacred Roll which contains the tenets & precepts of their religion—& who formed their political Constitution as it respects the connection of various kingdoms or tribes under one government    There are many anecdotes, which
tradition has handed down respecting this extraordinary man which have the complexion of  [the miraculous & hence I conclude they must be fabulous']  fables— [Such as]  as for instance he is represented as forming a curious machine  &  having seated himself upon it he mounted into the atmosphere & assended a great hieght—& having sailed a considerable distance thro the air he decendedslowly & received no damage—that multitudes of astonished spectators had, a number of times seen him perform this miraculous exploit—& that he declared that when he took these excurtions his extraordinary wisdom & knowledge was communicated to him—If he did in fact perform such exploits no wonder that he managed an ignorant people as he pleased—But as it is not my intention to amuse my readers by a splended relation of fables I shall confine myself to facts which cannot be contested —The place of his nativity is not recorded-The first account given of him was his appearance in the great city of Tolanga which is situate on the Banks of the Siota River. When he entered that city he was^ attended by his wife & four sons, the eldest of which was about eighteen years of age—He himself appeared to be about forty. His personal appearance was commanding, being of midling stature—of a bold frank countenance & eyes livly and penetrating, In his general deportment he was chearful, yet displayed much sedateness & gravity.—He was affable and familliar in conversation but not loquacious—He never would converse long on trifling subjects—had a wonderful facility to intermix some wise sayings & remarks  [that should improve] &  of turning with dignity & gracefulness the attention of the company to subjects that were important  &  interesting—None could then withstand the energy of his reasoning—& all were astonished at the inginuety of his arguments & the great knowledge & wisdom which he displayed—His fame spread thro the city and country  &  multitudes frequently assembled & importuned him to give them instruction—^Always cheerful to gratify the curiosity  &  comply with the reasonable requests
of the multitude he entertained them by conversing with them familiarly—& by exhibiting public Discourses—All were charmed with his wisdom & eloquence—& all united in pronouncing him to be the most extraordinary man in existence & generally believed that he held conversation with celestial beings—& always acted under the influence of divine inspiration.—The people wiBre very liberal in their donations, which enabled him to support his family in affluence—Having thus in a short time established a character superior with respect to wisdom & eloquence to any man who had ever appeared before him in the nation, he then, at an enterview which he held with the King & the chiefs, told them, that he had invented the art of expressing ideas by certain marks or characters—& having explained the nature of the subject to their full satis-fection he then proposed to establish a school for .the instruction of the sons of the principal subjects of the King.—The proposal was received & accepted with much gratitud & cheerfulness—A house was immediately prepared for the accommidation of schoUars & in a short time the numbers amounted to near two hundred.—But here it must be observed that the art of making  &  applying the characters to the words which they represented—was taught principally by his sons—they had all received an education from their fetther— &  even the youngest, who was but about eleven years old could read and write with great correctness & facility—He superintended their instruction & very frequently gave them lectures on scientiffic & moral subjects—^his scoUars made great progress in learning— &  delighted their parents with the improvements they had made in literature civilization & refinement.—He still continued to associate among the people  &  was indefatigable in his labours to dispel their ignorance, correct their superstition & vices to excite their industry & to defuse a more accurate knowledge of the mechanical arts —«-The manufacture of Iron in particular was not known; this he taught a number by showing them how to build a small
furnace & to cast iron ware—& then how to build a small forge  &  refine pigs and convert them into Iron—He had resided among the Sciotans about three years  &  the happy effects of his Labors were visible to all observs—^A great reformation had taken place in the morals & manners of the people—^industry had encreased—agriculture & the mechanical arts had received great improvement—& houses were built on a more commodious <fe eligant construction—But not willing to stop here the benevolent mind of the great Lobaska mide-tated a more important revolution—now the propicious era had arived & the way was prepared for the introduction of that system of Theology which is comprised in the Sacred Roll— In the first place he read & explained the whole system to the king & the cheifs of the nation^ who cordially gave it their approbation & gave permission to propogate it among the people—Under a pretence that this system was revealed to him in several interviews which he had been permitted to have with the second son of the great  &  good Being— the people did not long hisitate, but received as sacred  & divine truth every word which he taught them They forsook their old religion which was a confused [<fe  absurd] medley of Idoletry & supersticious nonsence  &  embraced a religion more sublime & consistent—& more fraught with sentiments which would promote the happiness of mankind in this world.
Whilst the Siotans were thus rapidly progressing in their improvements they were unhappily disturbed by the certain prospect of war. Bombal the king of the Kentucks—a nation which lived on the south side of the great River Ohio, had taken great umbrage against Hadokam the King of Siota—This Bombal was the most haughty & powerful prince, who reigned in this part of the western Continent—^It had been the custom for several ages for the king  &  chiefs of the Ken-tucks to have the exclusive right to wear, in their Caps-a bunch of blue feathers, which designated their pre-eminance
over every nation.—The Siotan princes envying them this distinguished honor & considering themselves as being at least their equals assumed the liberty to place bunches of Blue feathers upon their Caps.—This in the opinion of the Ken-tucks, was an unpardonable offence, if persisted in, & a most daring insult upon their supereminent digjiity—[-4  messenger was immedi,']  After a solemn council was held with his chiefs, Bombal, with their unanimous consent dispached a messenger to Hadoram—who thus proclaimed—Thus saith Bombal, the king of kings & the most mighty prince on earth—ye have insulted our honour & dignity in assuming blue feathers, which was the badge of our preeminence—know ye that unless ye tear them from your Caps, ye shall feel the weight of our vengence. Hadoram replied, tell your Master that a great company of Wolves made an attack upon a city to rob the citizens of their dear <fe elk, & they let forth their dogs upon them, which attacked them with such fury & courage, that they fled, mangled, & torn, to a most dreary swamp— here by the most plaintive howling, they lamented their sad disaster & disgrace. ■
An answer so shrewd & insulting, it was expected would soon be followed by an invasion. Measures must immediately be taken for the defence of the kingdom—Lobaska was invited to set in Council—^all were unanimously of opinion that to comply with the haughty demand of Bombal, by tearing the blue feathers from their caps would be degrading the honour of the nation and a relinquishment of their natural right— they were likewise sensible that the most vigorous exertions were necessary to save the country from ruin. The opinion and advice of Lobaska, was requested. It is my opinion says he, that by using a little stratigem this war might be bro't to a conclusion which will be honourable to this kingdom. We will pursue, says the King, your advice  &  directions. I shall b^ happy, says Lobaska to assist you with my best advice— Call immediately into the field an army of Three thousand
men—^provide two thousand shovels, five hundred mathooks, & one thousand wheelbarrows— &  one hundred axes; I will give directions how to make them—^Not a moment was lost, the army was assembled and impliments provided with the utmost expidition—& they marched down the river to a certain place where the army of the enimy must pass, in order to arrive at the City of Tolanga At this place the hill or mountain came within less than a mile of the River  &  flat or level Land intervened—Here Lobaska directed that a Canal should be dug from the River  [to the River,']  to the Hill—That it should be eight feet wide & eight deep & that the dirt which they dug should be thrown into the River— [that the canaZ] except what should be wanting to lay over thin pieces of split timber, which should be extended across the Canal & so weak and slender that the weight of a man would break them down. This novel invention was soon carried into effect—& the work completely finished—Every precaution was used to prevent, any inteligence of these transactions from geting to the enimy. —In the meantime Hadokam bro't into the field seven thousand more of his warriors, men of brave hearts and valiant for the Battle—The indignant King of the Kentucks by this time had assembled an army of thirty thousand men who were ready at the risk of their lives to vindicate the pre-eminance of their nation and the transcendent dignity of their king & his chiefs— [Had of this]  At the head of this army Bombal began his march to execute his threatned vengance on the Siotans—As he entered their country he found the viliges deserted  &  all the movable property conveyed away—Not a man,  \_or worn]  to be seen until he came in view of the army of Hadokam, who was encamped within a small distance of the Canal.—Bombal halted and formed his men in two Ranks extending from the river to the hill—He had a Reserved core, who were placed in the rear of the main body—Having thus arranged them for battle, he went from one wing to the other —^proclaiming aloud, we have been insulted, brave soldiers, by
these cowardly Siotaus—They have assumed the blue Feather, the badg^ of our preeminance & exalted dignity—Behold it flying in their Caps—will your high born souls submit to behold such Dastards place themselvs on equal ground with you—No my valiant warriors, let usreveng the insult by the destruction of their puny army & the conflagration of their City—Make a furious charge upon them—& the victory is ours—Let your motto be the blue Feather & you will fight like wolvs robed of their puppies.—Hadoram had by this time formed his army in order of Battle close to the edge of the Canal & extended them only in one rank from the River to the Hill.—As the Kentucks approached within a small distance, the Sciotans gave back & began a retreat with apparent confusion, notwithstanding the pretended exertions of the King  & his ofiicers to prevent their retreating—Bombal observing this commanded to rush forward on the full run but to keep their Ranks in order—This they instantly obeyed as one man & as soon as their feet stept on the slender covering of the canal it gave way & they fell to the bottom, some in one position and some in another—A disaster so novel & unexpected must have appalled the stoutest heart & filled* their minds with amase-ment  &  terror.—Nor did this complete the misfortune of the army of Bombal—an ambush of the Sciotans, who lay on the side of the hill opposite to the reserved Corps of the Kentucks, rushed down upon them in an instant—Surprise & terror prevented resistance—they threw down their arms & surrendered —The retreating army of Hadoram immediately returned with shouting to the edge of the Canal—Their enimies, who but a moment before, tho't themselves invincible & certain of victory were now defenceless & wholly in their power—Lobaska was present & saw the success of his stratigem his great soul dis-dianed revenge on an helpless & prostrate Enimy—he conjured the Siotans not to shed one drop of Blood—but to be generous & merciful—Bombal had now recovered from his surprise &  seeing the deplorable situation of his army, his haughty
soul felt the keenest anguish—Where says he is the King ot the Siotans?—Here I am says Hadoram—whatsis your request my Brother? Reduced says he by a Stratagim the most ingenious & artful, to a situation which subjects us wholly under your power,  &  in which you can take ample revenge—I now emplore your generosity & compassion for my army—Spare their lives —& then name your terms & if I can comply with them, without degrading the honor of my Crown, it shall be done. Your request says Hadoram is granted— Surrender your arms—& let your army return in peace—^As for your majesty, & the chiefs of your nation, who are present, you will give us the pleasure of your company in our return to the city of Tolanga, & there we will execute a treaty of peace & amity that shall be advantageous & honourable to both nations.—These terms were accepted, & the Kentucks returned in peace to their own country, not to describe exploit, & bloody victories, but the curious Stratigim of Lobaska— The two Kings & their splendid Retinue of princes, having arived at Tolanga— \_every atterdion was paid by Hodaram ^ his chiefs to tlieir honorable visitors.^  Hodaram made a sumptuous entertainment at which all were present—The next day both. parties met for the purpose of agreeing to terms of peace & perpetual amity—What are your terms says Bombal—Lobaska says Hodaram shall be our Arbitrator—He shall name the terms—his wisdom will dictate nothing which will be dishon-erable to either party. Your proposal, says Bombal is generous Lobaska shall be our Arbitrator—Lobaska then rose— Attend says he, to my words ye princes of Siota & Kentuck; You have all derived your existence from the great father  ot Spirits—You are his children & belong to his great family— Why then have you thirsted for each others Blood for the Blood of Brethren—&  [what  /ww] what has produced this mighty war—A blue feather, a badge of preeminence. It is pride, it is cursed ambition & avarice which devastate the world  &  produce rivers of human Blood—& the wars which
take place among nations generally originate from as trifling causes asgbhe blue feathers.
Let this be  [the first article of]  your treaty that any person may wear a blue feather in his Cap—or any other feather that he pleases.— [Let this be second,']  that the individuals of each nation may carry on a commerce with each other— &  that they shall be protected in their persons and property.  [Let this be the third,]  that I shall be at liberty to establish  [a school  w] schools in any part of the domains of Kentuck  &  furnish them [such]  instructors  [as Iplease] —That none shall be restrained from hearing our instructions—& that we shall be patronized &  protected by the King  &  his chiefs— [Let this be the fourth] — that perpetual peace  &  amity shall remain between both nations—And as a pledge for the fulfilment of these articles, on the part of the princes of Kentuck—that the eldest son of the King & four sons of the principal Chiefs shall be left as hostiges in this City for  [the term of]  Term of three years. These terms met the cordial approbation of both parties & were ratified in the most solemn manner—
[Thus happy, was the termination of the war, about the blue feather, [having taken place] Lobaska proceeded with indefatigable indvMry & perseverance in his benevolent scheme of enlightening Sc reforming mankind. —]
And how happy would it be for mankind, if all wars about as trifling causes as this, might terminate in the same way The benevolent mind of Lobaska soared above trifles— viewing all mankind as brothers & sisters he wished the happiness of all.—Hence he made provision in the Treaty with the Kentucks for the introduction of Scools  [in Kentuck]  among them This was the first step, which he^ foresaw would introduce improvements in agriculture & the mechanical arts— produce a reformation in their morals & religious principals & a happy revolution in some part of their political institutions.
Bombal had became so captivated with Lobaska that he solicited him to bear him company to his own dominions—He
consented & when he had arived at the royal City of Gamba, which is situate on the River Kentuck—he there pursued the same course which he had done at Tolanga & his success answered his most sanguine expectations: The people were now prepared for the introduction of a school—He returned back  [to Tolanga] &  sent his second son & three of the most forward scoUars of the Sciotans to establish a school at Gamba —[ Jn  t?i€ lYiean time his intention was to make some amendments in tlie govefnvment of Sdota. — Bnt as there were several (Mies and a great number of vUiges, that acknowledged the jurisdiction of the Sciotan King,which stiU were ignorant of the principles ^ doctrines which he taught — he found it necessary to visit them ^ to introduce instructors amongst them. In this work he was engaged about two years —^  the happy effect of his labours were now visible in various kinds of improvements & in the reformation of manners, morals ^ religion. The way was now prepared to introduce his system of government —TTie  chiefs of the nation were invited to attend a grand council at Tolanga — When they were met — Lobaskarose — & presented them with the following constitution of goverment —
[The king of Siota shall be stiled the Emperor of Ohson ^ the King of Siota—His crown shall be hereditary in the oldest male heir of his family — The cities & vUages who'now acknowledged his jurisdiction or who may hereafter do it shall be entitled to protection from the empeivr — If invaded by an enimy he shall defend them with the force of the empire — once every year the chiefs shall meet at Tolanga to make laws for the good of the nation. —]
These young men having imbibed the spirit & principles of the great preceptor, spared no exertions to instruct the scholars &  to defuse useful knowledge among the people—The happy effects of their labours were visible in a short time. The people embraced the religion of Lobaska & became more industrious & civilized. In their various improvements in agriculture, the mechanical arts & literature they even exsaled the Sciotans & appeared to be as prosperous & flourishing— Even  Bombal himself declared that the termination of the
war about the blue feather—which at first appeared unfortunate yet as it occationed such happy feffects among his people it gave him more satisfaction  &  pleasure than  [the repviation of being a great Conqueror]  what he could have received from the reputation of being a great conqueror.
CHAP.   IX
Goverment  &  money
The people who were denominated Ohians, were setled on both sides of the River Ohio— &  along the various branches of the River—The settlements extended a great distance in the time of Lobaska—but how far it is not mentioned They lived in compact viliges or towns— [Wemight except the Cities Tolanga on the river Sciota^& Gamba on the River Kentuck — These various viliges or towns formed independent Soveranties — & were governed by their respective chiefs —]
Excepting the Cities of Tolanga & Gamba—whose Kings claimed jurisdiction over an extent of country about one hundred & fifty mile's along the River Ohio & about the same distance back from the river, the remaining part of this extensive country was setled in compact viliges or towns. These formed independent sovereigties & were governed by their respective Chiefs. Frequent bickerings, contentions and wars took place among these Chiefs, which were often attended with pernicious consequencies. To remidy these evils & to facilitate & accomplish the great & benevolent plan of reforming & ^ civilizing the Ohians, Lobaska had formed a system of Government, with a design of establing two great empires—one on each side of the River Ohio.—Their  [different']  constitutions were on the same plan—& were presented by the hand of Lobaska to the respective Kings of Sciota & Kentuck—
The Sciotan Constitution was comprised in the words.
The country east of the great River Ohio shall form the Erapire of Sciota—At the head of this empire shall be placed with the title of Emperor Labarmack the oldest son of Lobaska —The office shall be hereditary in the eldest male of his family—He and his sons successively shall mary natives of the kingdom of Sciota:—& all their daughters shall mary within their own dominions. He shall have four counsellors— He with the advice of his Councellors shall have the exclusive right of making war & peace & of forming treaties with other nations—He shall be commatider in chief of all the forces—& the King of Sciota shall be next to him—All controversies between the Rulers or chiefs of the different tribes shall be refered to the descicion of him & his Councellors—& he is authorised to compel a compliance—He shall hold his settings annually in four different parts of the empire. The King of Sciota  &  the chiefs of the different tribes shall hold their offices & exercise the same authority in civil matters that they have done—They shall be ameniable to the emperor & his councellors, whose duty it shall be to enquire into all complaints against them from their subjects, & to redress grievances & punish for oppression & injustice by fines.—He and his councellors shall have the exclusive priviledge of coining money— They may likewise lay taxes for the support of goverment & for the defence of the nation.—They shall coin no more money than what is necessary for the convenience of the people & in such quantity only that the value shall not depreciate—he shall appoint the officers of his army—except where the chiefs chuse to command their own subjects—^in that case they shall be subject to the command of the Emperor The people in every city, town or village shall respectively chuse one or more Censors—whose duty it shall be to enquire into all mal-conduct of Rulers—& all vicious & improper conduct of the preists & the people—& they shall pursue such measures to obtain justice  &  to produce a reformation of morals in the offenders as the laws shall direct.
In order that the priests  &  instructors of learning may know and perform their duty for the benefit of civilization, morality  &  religion. Lambon the third son of Lobaska shall preside over them & shall have the title of high Priest—& the office shall be hereditary in the eldest males of his family successively—There shall be associated with him four priests as his assistants—they shall exercise a jurisdiction over all the priests of the empire & shall see that they faithfully perform the duties of their office-~ They shall attend to the instructors of Learning—& shall direct that a suitable number are provided thro'out the empire—It shall likewise be their duty at all suitable times  &  places to instruct Rulers & people in the duties of their respective stations— &  to labour incessantly to persuade mankind to subject their passions & appetites under the government of Reason—that they may secure happiness to themselves in this life—& imortal happiness beyond the grave. —The people shall make contributions, in proportion to their wealth for the support of their priests—If any refuse, they shall be denied the privilege of their instructions— &  shall be subjected to the ridecule  &  contempt of the people.—For the convenience of the people  &  for the easy support of the gov-erment, it is necessary that there should be something which shall represent property—& which is of small weight. It is therefore provided that certain small pieces of iron—stamped in a peculiar manner, shall be this circulating medium, to represent property—Each peice according to its particular stamp shall have a certain value fixed upon it.—It shall be the peculiar prerogative of the Emperor & his councellors to direct the coining of these peices—which shall be denominated money— No more money shall be coined than what will be for the benefit of the empire—Nor shall the Emperor or his Counsellors receive any more of it, than an adequate compensation for their services.—They shall keep an account of the amount of money coined annually & the manner in which it has been distributed & expended.   This amount shall be submitted to
t the examination of the King of Siota & the   chiefs of the
empire. The Emperor shall always be ready to receive the petitions  &  complaints of his subjects—He shall consult the welfare of his people & save them from oppression  &  tyranny— &  by his beneficent acts shall gain their affection & obtain the apala-tion of a just, a good & gracious Prince.—
When Hadoram king of Sciota had received this plan of government, he immediately assembled all the Chiefs or princes within his kingdom Lobaska pointed out the defects of the existing goverment, & the excellences of that form which he presented for their acceptance—His reasons could not be resisted— they unanimously agreed to establish it as their constitution of Groverment. Labamack accepted the office of Emperor, & his four counsellors were appointed—Lambon was ordained High priest & his four assistance chosen—^The new goverment was now put in opperation—The various tribes living contiguous to the empire seeing its prosperity sollicited the priviledge of being received as parts of the empire—^Their requests were granted. Improvement & prosperity attended them—This induced other contiguous Tribes to request the same priviledge —& others still adjoining them came forward with their petitions, all were granted & the same regulations established in every part—^Within about three years from the first establishment of the empire Lobaska had the pleasure of seeing his son reign over a territory of more than four hundred miles in length along the River Ohio— &  of beholding a nation rapidly progressing from a state of barbarism, ignorance & wretchedness to a state of civilization knowledge & prosperity—
Having now beheld the happy success of his experiment at Sciota, Lobaska made a second viset to Bambo king of Ken-tuck. His second son whose name was Hamback was present at the City of Gamba. His youngest son Kato attended him—^ He made known his plan of revolution to Bambo who cordially acquiesed—& calling together his princes—^they unimously agreed to place Hamback on the throne of the
empire south of the Ohio River—& to ordain Kato as their high priest—With the exception of names & places the Constitution of goverment was the same as that which the Sciotans adopted—^The same measures were pursued to ensure its sucess—A great  &  flourishing empire arose—& barbarous tribes connecting themselves with the empire & under the fostering care of the goverment became civilized wealty & prosperous.—
Thus within the term of twelve years from the arival of Lobaska at Tolanga, he had the satisfaction of beholding the great  &  benevolent objects which he had in view accomplished —He still continued his useful Labours—& was the great Oricle of both empires—His advise & sentiments were taken upon all important subjects— &  no one ventured to controvert his opinions—^He lived to behold the successful experiment of his institutions—& to see them acquire that strength  &  firmness as not easily to be overthrown. Having acquired that renown  &  glory which are beyond the reach of envy & which aspiring ambition would dispair of attaining—at the age of Eighty he bade an affectionate adue to two empires & left them to lament in tears his exit.
These two empires continued to progress in their improv-ments  &  population  &  to rival each other in prosperity during the reign of Ten successive Emperors on the Throne of Sciota —Peace & harmony & a friendly intercourse existed between them—No wars took place to disturb their tranquility except what arose from the surrounding Savages, who sometimes disturbed the frontiers in a hostile manner for the sake of gaining plunder. But these attacks were generally repelled & defeated without much loss of blood—They were in fact of such trifling consequence as to make no perceptible impediment to prevent the population, improvement or prosperity of both Empires— & happyJhrice happy would it have been for them, if they had still continued to have pursued the amiable & benevolent principles which first marked the commencement & progress of their institutions

Military arrangements.   Amusements.   Gastom«.   Extent of the Empire.
Forts.
The Customs & amusements of a Nation evince the state of Society which exists among the people—When the two Empires of Sciota & Kentuck had commenced their new career on the plan which was formed by Lobaska—they adopted this as a true maxim, that to avoid war it was necessary to be in constant preparation for it.—It was the wise policy of the two goverments to make such military arrangements as never to be surprized by an enimy unprepared. In every city, town & vilage the people were required to provide military impli-ments & to deposit them in a secure place. These magizines were to contain a sufficient quantity of arms to furnish every man who should be destitute—[7n  order that every man might have sufficient skill to use them to advartto/ge, great pains was taken to prepare him by teaching him the art of war.^  The knowledge of military tackticks as it was th^n attainable, was likewise defused among the people.—Young men from sixteen to twenty years old, were required to take the field four times in each year, & to spend sixteen days during each time in learning the military art & in building fortifications—And every able bodied man was required to spend eight days in each year in the same employment.—In consequence of these regulations a revalship existed among the different sexions of the empires to exceed each other in skill & dexterity in miletery manoevers—Hence it was a general custom in every part of the country for different bodies of men to meet— [to engorge in feigned Battles]  once every year, in order to make a display of their improvements in the art of war—Primeums were given
to those who were the most expert in shooting the arrow or in managing the spear  &  the sword.
Their Amusements were generally of the athletick kind —calculated to improve their agility & strength— &  prepare them for warriors. Wrestling, slinging & throwing stones at marks—^leaping ditches & fences & climbing trees and prici-pices were some of their most favorite diversions—And as they took great pains to perfect themselves in these exercises it would astonish spectators of other nations to observe the improvement they had made in the extraordinary feats of agility & strength which they exhibited.—
Other diversions, which had no tendency to fit them for war, they seldom practised, except when in the company of women—Being taught by their religion the social virtues they manifested a great regard for the rights of the other sex & always treated them with attention, civility & tenderness— Hence it was curious to observe that  [when in the company of women]  they easily exchanged the  [warriors]  ruged  [& bold] attitude of the bold warrior for the complasant [<fc  tender'} deportment of the affectionate galant—The amusements which were pleasing to the female mind were equally pleasing to the men whenever they held their social meetings for recreation.— These meetings were frequent among the younger class of Citizens, whether married or single—Various kinds of amusements would frequently be introduced at such times for their mutual entertainment—but that which held the most conspicuous place was dancing—But their manner of dancing was different from that of the polished Europians.—Gracefulness & easy attitude were not so much studied in their movments as sprightliness  &  agility—those tunes which admited the greatest display of activity and sprightliness were generally the most  [pleasing &]  fashionable—Hence those Bodies were formed for the quickest, if they keept time with the music were the most admired.—
In small assemblies it was fashionable to amuse them-
selves  [tuUK]  at playing with peices of parchment—This they denominated the Bird Play. Each peice was of an oval form & of convenient length & width— &  on each one is portraied the likeness of a Bird—All the birds of Prey that came within their knowledge, have the honour of being represented on these peices of Parchment—On the other peices are portraied other Birds of different kinds—The whole number of the peices amount to about sixty—These are promiscuously placed in a pack & dealt of to the company of Players whose number does not exceed six—The person then, who has the greatest number of carniverous Birds—by a dextrous managment^ may ca.tch the greatest number of the other Birds— &  thus obtain the victory.—
During these ent^rviews of the different sexes—& even in their common intercourse with each other they are always very cheerful & sociable & often display that fondness & familiarity, which in Europe, would be considered indicative of a lacivi-ous character—but in this country are considered as harmless, as what good manners required.—Nothing rude, nothing indecent or immodest according to their ideas of the meaning of these terms, are admissible in company— &  absolute lacivious-ness would meet the most severe reprehension.—
When a young man wishes to settle himself in a family state, he proclaims it by wearing a red feather in his Cap. This is considered as an admonition to the young women, who would not receive him for a husband to avoid his company— whereas those whose inclinations towards him are more favourable admit his attention—from this number he selects one as the object of his addresses—He obtains an interview & proposes a courtship—If the proposition accords with her wishes, they then agree on a time, when he ^hall make known the affair to her parents —whose approbation being obtained he is then permitted to visit her ten times in sixty days. At the expiration of this time, the bargain for matrimony must be finished.   Otherwise there must be a final termination or a
postponement of the courtship for the term of one year:  [The parties are ai liberty, during the postponement to"]  But if the parties are pleased with each other, the contract is made & the time for the performance of the nuptial cerimonies is appointed—An entertainment is provided—friends are invited —& the Bridegroom & Bride present themselves in their best apparal—The company form a circle  &  they take their stand in the center—The father of the Bride speaks, For what purpose do you present yourselves—They answer, to join hands in wedlock, Our hearts are already joined  &  we have made a solem covenant to be true and faithful to each other— The company then all exclaim—"Blessings will attend you, if ye fulfil—but curses if ye transgress.—They are then conducted to a log round which, a Rope is tied—The Bridegroom takes hold of one end of the rope & the Bride the other—& being commanded to draw the Log into the house, they pull in opposite directions with all their might. Having worried themselves for some time to no purpose, to the great diversion of the company, the parents of both parties step forward—<fe giving them a severe reprimand command them to draw in the same direction—They instantly obey—& the Log is easily drawn to its destined place. The rest of the time is spent with great chearfulness  &  merriment,—They partake of the entertainment & conclude with customary amusements.—
The Bridegroom & Bride are now desirous to form a family by themselves—If their parents are of sufficient ability they furnish them with a convenient house and such furniture as will be required for family use & such other property as they need, to enable them to obtain a comfortable living. But if their parents are poor they receive assistance and contributions from relations  &  neighbours & are placed in such a situation that with proper industry  &  econimy, they can live above indigence & enjoy life agreeably. At the time they enter their new habitation, they are attended by a Priest  &  by their relation  &  friends—They kneel in the center of the Room—& the
priest places his right hand, on the head of the Bridegroom & his left on the head of the Bride—After explaining  &  enjoining in the most solemn manner, the various duties of the marriage state he concludes his injunctions with these words—l5[y dear children, I conjure you, [as  you regard your own peace & felicity —OS  you would wish to acquire wealth & re8pectihility—& set an example worthy of emitation, that as you are now yoked together] to draw in the same direction. They then rise and he presents each with a peice of Parchment on which is written—Draw in the same direction. All the duties of the conjugal state, in their opinion, are comprized in this  [injunction']  Command.
\_As the Priests & the Censors were [yigilent & careful] to see that parents restrained the vices of their children & instructed them in the knowledge of their religious principles — the effects were very conspicuous Parents] —
Having been early taught to  \restrain the]  govern their passions & to regard the practice of virtue as their greatest good, it was generally the case, that love, friendship & harmony existed in families,  \& when parents were treated by their children withgre ai tenderness & respect — ]  Parents manifested an anxious soUicitude for the future welfare & respectability of their Children,—& in their turn children treated their parents with respect  &  reverance.—Nor did they forsake them in old age—but provided liberally for their support—But we are not to suppose that in the most virtuous age of the nation, all were virtuous—Far from this. But with such punctual exactness were the laws executed, in the most prosperous state of the nation, that vice  &  impiety had but few advocates & the wicked were ashamed of their own characters.—Tho' every vice was prohibited by Law, yet the penalties were not severe—^Murder alone was punished with death— with respect to other Laws, they were calculated to wound the pride of & ambition of the transgressor, & produce shame  & regret—
Adultery is punished by obliging the culprit to were a
pair of Elk-horns on his shoulders §ix days & to walk thro* the city or vilage once each day, at which times the boys are at liberty to pelt him with rotten eggs.—The theif is compelled to make* ample restitution—For the third offence he is covered with tar & feathere & exhibited as a specticle for laughter  & ridicule. Pugilists or boxers, if they are equally to blame for fighting are yoked together at least one day—& in this situation are presented to the view of the multitude. They must were the yoke until the quarrel is setled. Such being the nature of their penal Laws  &  such the punctuality of executing the penalties on offenders, that crimes were far less free-quent in this country than in Europe where the Laws are more severe—<fe offenders more often escape punishment. Tho' learning, civilization & refinement had not arived to that state of perfection in which they exist in a great part of the Roman Empire—yet the two Empires of Sciota & Kentuck during their long period of peace  &  prosperity were not less happy. As luxery  &  extravigance were scarcely known to exist, especially among the common people, [an  happy equality was] hence there was a great similarity in their manner of living, their dress, their habits & manners.—Pride was not bloated & puffed up with enormous wealth—Nor had envy fewel to inflame her hatred & malice—As the two empires were not displeased with each others prosperity & happiness —[<fe  the two goverments had no thirst']  nor jealous of each others power—. & as the goverments were not infected with a thirst for conquest peace of consequence waved her olive branch & the maligant passions lay dormant—As avarice & corruption did not contaminate the ruling powers nor bribery infect the seats of justice the people felt secure in the enjoyment of their rights, & desirous to raise up families to partake of the same blessings which they enjoyed.—
We can now trace the causes of their increase & prosperity. To a religion, which presented powerful motives to restrain vice & impiety, & encourage virtue—To the defusion of a com-
petant share of learning & knowlege to enable the people to understand their rights & enjoy the pleasures of social intercourse—To the establishment of political institutions^ which garded property & life against oppression injustice & tyranny —to the knowledge which the people obtained of agriculture & the mechanical arts & their habits of industry & economy— To the mild nature of their laws & the certainty of executing the penalties upon transgressors—& to such an equality of property as to prevent the pride of wealth & the extravagance of luxury—To such causes may be ascribed the rapid increase of population & the contentment & felicity which extended thro* every of the country.—We might^ add likewise the long peace that continued & the friendly intercourse that existed between the two rival Empires—A peace which had no interruption for the term of near five hundred years—During this time their vilages & cities were greatly enlarged—new settlements were formed in every part of the country which had nc^ been inhabited—& a vast number of towns were built— which rivaled as to number of inhabitants, those which existed at the time their imperial goverments were founded.—Their settlements extended the whole length of the great River Ohio to its confuence with the Mississippi, & over the whole country on both sides of the Ohio River, which are watered by streams which empty into it.—And also along the great Lakes of Eri & Mishigan & even some settlements were formed in some part of the country which borders on Lake Ontario.—Such was the vast extent of the country which they inhabited—& such the fertility of the soil that many millions were easily fed & supported with such a plenty & competence of provision, as was necessary for their comfort and happiness—
During the time of their rising greatness & tranquility their policy led them to fortify their country in every part, the interior as well as the frontiers—this they did partly for their own safety, provided a war should take place & they should be invaded by an enimy—& partly to keep alive [a  military]
1
& improve a warlike spirit & the knowledge of military Tac-ticks. Near every vilage or city they constructed forts or fortifications. Those were generally of an oval form & of diflferent dimentions according to the number of inhabitants who lived in the town.—The Ramparts or walls, were formed of dirt which was taken in fr6nt of the fort. A deep canal or trench would likewise be formed—This would still encrease the difficulty of surmounting the walls in front.—In addition to this they inserted a piece of Timber on the top of the Ramparts—These peices were about seven feet in length from the ground to top which was sharpned—The distance between each peice was about six inches—thro, which they could shoot their arrows against an Enimy. Some of their fortifications have two Ramparts, which run paralel with each other built in the same manner, with a distance between of about two or three perches—Their Gates are strong & well constructed for defence—Within these forts are likewise a number of small houses—for the accomidation of the army & inhabitants.in case of an invasion—& likewise a storehouse for the reception of provision & arms, A couiltry thus fortified—containing so many milion of inhabitants, hardy & robust  &  with habits formed for war—might well be supposed as able to defend themselves against an invading Enimy—If they were, beat from the frontier, they could still retreat back to the fortifications in the interior & their make a succesful stand—But what avails all the wisdom, the art & the works of men—what avails their valour, their strength  &  numbers when the Almighty is provoked to chastise them  &  to execute his vengence in their overthrow  &  destruction—
CHAT   XI—
As the Sciotans & Kentucks had maintained with each ' other an unterrupted peace & friendly intercourse for the space of four hundred & eighty years, it seems almost incredible, that a cause, which was of no great importance to either nation, should excite their resentment against each other & produce all the horrors of war.—But such were the unhappy effects of an aflfair, which had no regard to a single person, except the imperial families of the two empires & the King of Sciota^—
As these families were descended from the great Lobaska, they had, during the reigns of all their Emperors been in the habit of visiting each other, but as each Emperor & his children were required not to marry out of their respective dominions, no intermarriages had taken place. They however claimed relationship & still continued to each other, the appellation of our dearest  &  best beloved Cousen.—A Cousen of this description, who was the eldest son of Hamboon the Emperor of Kentuck arived at the City of Talanga with a small but splendid Retinue of Friends.—At that time Rambock, who was the fourteenth Emperor, was siting on the throne of Siota—He received the young Prince with apparent sensations of the highest pleasure & spared no pains to manifest towards him by his treatment the greatest esteem and friendship. The Emperor had an only son, whose name was Moonrod—He ordered him to attend the young Prince & to treat him with every to- of aflfection & honour. They spent their time in receiving visets from the officers of the gover-ment—in viewing curiosities, & in the assemblies of the first class of young citizens who met for recreation.—^Elseon, for this was the name of the young Prince, was, soon after his arival, introduced to Lamesa, the eldest daughter   of  the
Emperor—She was a young Lady of a very fair and beautiful countenance. Her features & the construction of her person, were formed to please the fancy, whilst the ease, the gracefulness & modesty of her deportment were very pleasing to all her acquaintance—Her mind was replenished with the principles of knowledg:e & virtue—& such was her vivacity & the ease with which she expressed her ideas, that all were delighted with her conversation.—No wonder that this fair imperial damsel attracted the v attention of Elsion—&. at their first enterview, enkindled a spark in his boosom—which he could hardly prevent from being discovered thro his blushing countenance  &  the embarisment he felt in conversation. He strove to erase those tender impressions which she had made on his heart—but in vain—every renewed enterview only served to fix her image deeper in his mind, & to make the flame of Love more difficult to extinguish. He reasoned on the obsticles in the way of obtaining this young Lady for his partner—but instead of cooling it only encreased the ardor of his passion & produced a resolution, that with the consent of Lamesa, nothing should prevent the attainment of his wishes.—To a mind thus ardent, which possessed the native courage resolution  &  perseverence of Elseon, the most gigantic obsticles would vanish into vapour.—Nor was it long before he found that a correspondent passion was existed in her breast. The moment she first saw him her heart palpitated—her face was covered with crimson.—She turned her eyes  &  attempted to speak—her tongue stopt its motion in the middle of a period— She hamed—sat down <fe observed that she was not well.—A discription of this scene is painted by a Sciotan Bard in poetic numbers—he represents the young Lady as recovering in a short time from this state of agitation & confusion & as being afterwards composed, & of having a better command of her |)assions. To follow this Poet in the description which he gives of Elsion, to whom he attaches a countenance & figure, superior to other mortals—& qualities which produced uni-
versal esteem & admiration, would not comport with the faithful page of history. Suffice it to say that Lamesa was captivated with his person,  &  was impressed with those ideas  &  sentiments, that her happiness* fled, except when she either enjoyed or antisipated his company. After Elsion had firmly determined to marry Lamesa he was impatient for a private enterview with her to disclose his sentiments—This occured in a short time. They were together in one of apartments of the Emperors palace—the company had all retired.— I have said he in a low voice to Lamesa—conceived that opinion of you, that I hope you will not be displeased if I express my feelings with frankness  &  sincerityji—You must, she replied be the best judge of what is proper for you to express—I am always pleased with sincerity. As the sun, says he my dear Lamesa, when he rises with his radiant beams dispels the darkness of knight, so it is in your power to dispel the clouds of anxiety which rest upon my soul—The Crown of Kentuck will be like a Rock upon my head, unless you will condesend to share with me the glory & felicity of my reign. Will you consent to be my dearest friend & companion for life? There is nothing she replies would give me more pleasure than a compliance with your request, provided it shall meet the approbation of my Father—But how can he consent, when our Constitution requires that his daughters should marry in his own dominions? Besides my father intends that I shall receive the King of Sciota for my husband. By performing says he, the cerimonies of Mariage at Tolanga we shall literally comply with the imperial constitution, as Talanga is within the dominions of your Father—But as for this King of Sciota do you sincerely wish to have him for a husband? No, she quickly speaks, anger sparkled in her eyes—No! The King of Sciota for my husband! his pride, his haughtiness—the pomposity of all his movements, excite my perfect disgust. I should as leave be yoked to a porcupine.—
These Lovers, as you  may well  conjecture, said  many
things too tender & endearing to please the taste of the common class of Lovers—In this enterview, which lasted al^out four hours, they exchanged the most transporting expressions of Love—^made the most solemn vows of sincerity & perpetual friendship— &  finally agreed that Elseon should make known to the Emperor their mutual desire to be joined in wedlock. The next day he wrote to the Emperor as follows—
May it please your most excellent Majesty. Permit me to express my most sincere gratitude for the high favours & honour which thro' the beneficence of your majesty, I have injoyed in your dominions—I am likewise impelled to request a favour wiich to me would be the most precious gift that is in the power of your majesty to bestow—Having contracted an acquaintance with your most amiable daughter Lamesa & finding that a correspondent affection & esteem exist in our hearts towards each other  &  a mutual desire to be united by the solemn covenant of mariage, I would therefore solicit your, majesty's permission, that such a connection may be formed.—Such a connection, I conceive, may in its effects be very salutary  <& beneficial to both Empires—It will unite the two imperial families nearer in the bond of consanguinity & fix upon them an additional obligation to cultivate friendship, peace & amiable intercourse—It will strengthen the sinues of both goverments & promote an happy interchange of friendly offices.—As to the objection whi(3h might arise from the constitution requiring, that the Emperors daughters should marry in his own dominions—This according to its literal meaning can have no respect only to the place where the Emperors Daughters shall marry—If by your Majesties permission I should marry your daughter Lamesa, in your dominions it will be a literal fulfilment of the constitution. From this ground therefore I conceive no objection of any weight can arise— Will your majesty please to vouchsafe an answer to my request. Signed.   Elseon,  Prince of Kentuck.
This letter was presented to the Emperor by Helicon an ^   intimate friend of Elseon.—The Emperor readj\it—assumed
the aspect of deep consideration—walked the room a few moments, then took a seat & told Helicon ^that he might inform the young prince—that he should receive an answer within T6n days.—
But why Ten days—a long time for two ardent Lovers to remain in suspense—But the Emperor must consult his Counsellors, his priests— &  the last & most fatal councellor of all the King of Sciota, who presumed to claim the hand of the fair Lamesa—The affair became public—The popular sentiment at first favoured the connection—The Emperors Coun-cellors & his priests were at first inclined to recommend an aflSrmative answer. But the interest of the Sciotan King soon prevailed—This produced a different view of the subject—The Councellors perceived that such a connection would be a most flagrant violation of the true meaning & spirit of the constitu-^   tion & the Priests considered that it would be an act of the
greatest impiety, as it would transgress an explicit injunction of the great founder of their goverment & religion. This opinion had vast weight on the minds of a great majority of the people. The more liberal sort vindicated the cause of Elseon —This produced a great debate, altercation & confusion thro' the City—All were anxious to know the Emperors descision—
On the tenth day the Emperor transmitted to the prince the following answer to his letter—
To our best beloved Cousen Elseon, Prince of Kentuck. The letter we received from your Highness has impressed our hearts with a deep sense of the honour & benefits which you intended our family & impire—At first we were inclined to accept of the alliance you proposed—^But having considered the subject with great seriousness & attention we find that to admit your Highness, who is not a citizen of our Empire, to marry into our family, would be a most flagrant violation of
the true meaning and spirit of our Constitution  &  an impious outrage on the sacred memory of its Founder—For these reasons we must solicit your Highness, not to insist on our compliance with your request.
Signed   Hambock  Emperor of Sciota.
As Elseon had been informed of the complexion which his aflFairs had assumed in the court & thro' the City he was prepared for the answer which he received.—Without manifesting the least chagrine or Resentment, he appeared to acquiesce in the decision of the Emperor. He displayed in his countenance, Jiis conversation  &  deportment his usual cheerfulness &  vivacity. He continued his amusements, & associated with company with the same ease, gracefulness and dignified conduct which he had done before.—At the same time his determination was fixed to' transport the fair Lamesa into his fathers dominions.—The first interview which he had with her after he received the Emperors Letter, he informed her of its contents.—She trembled, paleness began to cover her face & had not Elseon received her into his arms, perhaps she would have falen from her seat—However by a few soothing words  &  caresses, she was restored to her former composure  & recollection—Believe me, quoth he ■ my dearest Lamesa—you shall be mine—This heart shall be taken from my bosom <fe these limbs from m}^ Body, nothing else shall prevent our union  &  compleat enjoyment of happiness.—Can the ancient scribbling of a great Sage or the decree of an Emperor prevent the Streams from uniting with the Ocean—with the same ease & propriety can they prevent the union of our hands since our hearts are united.—with your consent, you shall be mine! Is it possible, she replies, is it possible 0 Elseon, to disregard the authority of an indulgent  &  beloved Parent & disobey his command—This I never did—What if he should command you says Elseon to marry the King of Siota, would you obey. —He might she replies, with more regard to my happiness
\
command me to plunge a dagger into my heart—I cannot indure that supercilious bundle of pride & aflfectation.
At this moment her maid entered the room & gave her a Letter. I received this Letter she says, from your Brother, who told me it was from the Emperor. Lamesa opened the Letter  &  read—
My dearest & best beloved Daughter—Having the most tender &,aflfectionate regard for your future welfare & felicity we have concluded a treaty of marriage between you & Sambal the King of Sciota—This aliance will be honourable to our family—& be productive of many benefits to the Empire. On the tenth day from this time the nuptual ceri-monies will be consummated in our Palace—You will be in readiness & yield a cheerful compliance with our will.—
Signed,   Rambock,  Em. of Sciota.
Had the Lightning flashed from the clouds <fe pierced her heart, it could not have produced a more instantaneous effect —She fell into the arms of Elseon—the maid ran for a cordial —Elseon rubed her temples & hands & loosned the girdle about her waist. Within about an hour the blood began to circulate. Elseon to his inexpressible joy felt her pulse begin-ing to beat & perceived flashes of colour in her face—With a plaintive groan she opened her eyes once more to the beams of day—& in a kind of wild destraction exclaimed—Ah cruel cruel Father—why have you doomed your daughter to a situation the most odious  &  disgustful—As well might you have thrown her into a den of porcupines, opossums & serpents—With such animals I could enjoy life with less disgust  &  torment, than with this mighty King of Sciota.—An aliance with him an honour to our family—an honour to the decendents of the great Lobasca!—What wicked councellors have deceived my father  &  induced hirn to thro' me into the arms of  this hateful monster—Ah whether shall  I fly <&
escape my barberous destiny.—I am your protector, says Elseon —I am your friend <fe will conduct you beyond the loving  & gigantic grasp of Sambal.—His loathsome arms shall never incircle my dear Lamesa—:Consent to my request & we will be within ten days at the City of Gamba—Their you will be esteemed as the brightest orniment of my Fathers Empire.—
No longer she replies, 0 Elseon can I refuse my consent to your proposal. When a compliance with my fathers command will entail wrechedness & misery thro' life. Heaven will pardon my disobedience—Yes Elseon I will go with you—& place my happiness in your power—I would share with you the worst of fortune, rather than fall into the hands of this haughty Sambal.  [What could she say more,'to express the feelings of a heart strugling under the operation of different passions & opposite motives — She has taken her resolution — Love has gained the preeminence over every obsticle.'l
[At this resolution Elseon was transported with joy — he now proceeds to form his plans for their flight. On the fourth day after he called upon the Emperor & requested his permission to depart to his own country — The Emperor importuned him to tarry & be one of the guests at Lamesa^s weding — But he declined by urging as his apoligy the anxiety & impatience of his father for his return, — Permission was granted & the Emperor added that Tie should do himself the honour to furnish the Prince with an escort when he left the Oity — Elseon replied that he was not fond of much parade, he would wish the escort might consist of the Emperor's Children only with each of them a friend. These says he are my dearest & best beloved cousens, for whom I shaU ever retain the most sincere friendship — Nothing can afford me more pleasure says the Emperor than to comply with your request, — Elseon took an affectionate leave of the Emperor & on the second day after, being prepared for his journey, he sat off with his three friends & their servants — Moonrod prince of the empire & Lamesa, with her two sisters — With each of them a friend attended him on his journey about twenty miles — They all tarryed at a vUiage over night—']
Imagination alone can paint the pleasant  &  happy scene —Elseon was transported with joy—He prest her to his bosom with all the ardor of inthusiasm & she yielded to all his tender  &  innocent embraces, with a grateful sensibility & modest resignation.
The invention  &  inginuity of  Elseon   must   now   be employed in forming a plan of their flight to his fathers dominions—As he appeared to acquiesse in the decision of the Emperor  & had  maintained the same cheerful deportment none were suspicious of his designs—The Emperor & the whole Court, still manifested toward him every token of high respect  &  sincere friendship.   Without  any hesitation  the Emperor cheerfully complied with his request, that his dear Cousens— the son and the three daughters of the Emperor, with each of them a friend, should accompany him about twenty miles, on his return to Kentuck—The ritenue of the young Prince consisted of four of his most intimate friends & other servants—He took  care   to   send   their   baggage   on by two servants one day before they set out—The morning arived—the sun shone with radiant splendor—not a cloud intervened or was seen to float in the atmosphere—It was the fourth day after Lamesa had received the Letter which doomed her to the embraces of Sambal—The Emperor, his Counsellors, his priests & principal officers assembled—& having invited the young prince & his friends to meet them, they entered the circle with great cerimony.   The Emperor then addressed the Young Prince, thanked him for the honour of his viset & expressed his firm determination to maintain a sincere friendship & an inviolable peace with the goverment of Kentuck. Elseon replied—that these sentiments would meet the cordial approbation of his Father—^who retained the same sentiments of friendship & peace toards the goverment of Siota—He then thanked the Emperor  &  whole assembly for the high respect they had shewn him—This was done with that frankness  & apparent   sencerity   that   the whole  assembly were highly
pleased—The Emperor then embraced him  &  gave him his blessing—Customary cerrimonies were mutually exchanged by tae whole company—& even tears were seen to drop from every eye.
As the whole of this parade indicates no flight of Elseon & Lamesa, we might now view them, with their select company of friends seting out on a short journey. All mounted on horses, they rode about twenty miles to a vilage were they halted. An eligant supper was provided—they were cheerful  &  socible—none appeared more so than Elseon & Lamesa.— The next day Elseon requested the company of his dea/ cousens a short distance on his journey—When they had rode about two miles they halted  &  proposed to take their lave of each other. Lamesa <fe her friend without being perceived by the company rode on.—It was a place where the road turned & by riding one rod they could not be seen. The rest of the company entered into a short conversation & passed invitations for reciprocal visits & friendly offices—They then clasped each others hands, & bowing very low took an aflfectionate farewell—But Where are Lamesa & her friend—During these cerimonies their horses moved with uncommon swiftness—her heart palpitates with an apprehension that she might be overtaken by her Brother—But now a friend more dear, her beloved Elseon, with his companions, outstrip the wind in their speed— &  within one hour & half they overtake these fearful Damsels. They all precipitate their course basting their eyes back every moment to her pursuors. But pursuers had not sufficient time to overtake them—They safely arive on the Bank of the great River—Elseon  &  Lamesa were the first that entered the Boat —the Rest follow— &  such was Elseon's engagedness & anxiety to secure his fair prize, that. he even seized an oar,& used it with great strength & dexterity— As their feet steped on the opposite shore—Elseon clasped his hands & spoke aloud—Lamesa is mine; She is now beyond the grasp of a pompous Tyrant— &  the controul of a father,
whose mind is blinded by the sorded advice of a menial junto of Councellors  &  priests.—She is mine—& shall soon be the princis of Kentuck. Their movement is slow thro' the remain. ing part of the journey.—They at length arive at the great City of Gamba. We may now contemplate them as having new scenes to pass trough. Not to delineate the parade, which was made at the court of Hamboon, for the reception of his Son, Lamesa *& their friends—nor to describe the joy that was exhibited in every part of the City on their arival—&the universal surprise occationed by the story of the flight of these two Lovers—suffice.it to say that those wiio beheld Lamesa did not blame Elseon.—
As Hamboon was not very punctilious in his regard to the Constitution, being possed of very liberal sentiments, Elseon found no difficulty in obtaining his consent to marry Lamesa—On the fourth day after their arival, Elseon & Lamesa with each of them a friend—appeared on a stage which was erected on the public square of the City—The Emperor & empress with his councellors, his priests, his officers  &  all his relation with the principal Ladies of the city formed a procession & surrounded the stage—The common citizens being a great multitude took their stand as they pleased—The Emperor & Empress then mounted the stage & united Elseon & Lamesa in the bond of wedlock according to custom—And as pulling the Log was an indispensible ceri-mony, one was provided with a rope round it on the stage— The Bridegroom & bride played their parts in pulling the Rope with such dexterity & gracefulness—that the whole assembly were most pleasingly entertained. When all was ended-The whole assembly claped their hands & cried, long live Elseon & Lamesa—& giving three huzzas the common citizens dispersed—The rest repaired to a sumptuous entertainment & spent the remaining part of the day & evening in conversation, singing & rereation.—
CHAP   XII—
The Reader will recollect that Elseon & his friends left Moonrod & his friends in a very pleasant mood without the least suspicion that Lamesa & her friend had deserted them. When they had arived at the vilage, what was their surprise when they found Lamesa & her friend were not in company— nor had any one any recollections of her being in company— after they had stoped to take their leave of Elseon. Moonrod & the other Gentlemen immediately rode back with the greatest speed to the place where they had halted, & not finding any traces of Lamesa, the conclusion was then certain that she had prefer the company of the young Prince & was on her way to Kentuck—Pursuit would be in vain, their only alternative was, to hasten back & carry the doleful intelligence to the Emperor. Their speed was nearly equal to that of Elseon Without waiting to perform the customary cerimony of entering the palace Moonrod immediately rushed into the Emperors presence & exclaimed, your daughter Lamesa has been seduced by Elseon to leave our company unperceived & has gone with him to Kentuck.—Nothing but the pencil of the Limner could paint the astonishment of the Emperor— He rose, stood motionless for a moment, then stairing fircely on Moonrod he spoke—is it possible, is it possible—are you not mistaken my Son.—I am not says he,'^my most excellent father, I am not mistaken—This morning we attended Elseon a small distance from the vilage where we lodged—when we halted to take our leave,  &  our attention was all engaged. She & her friend rode oflf unperceived by any of our company— nor did we miss her until we arived again at the vilage—We have made full search & enquiry & find that she has absolutely gone with the young prince to Kentuck. What an ingrate gays the Emperor, what a monster of hipocracy—Did the hon-
curable attention we have shown him demand such treatment? How has he insulted the dignity of our family <fe outraged the high authority of our govenment.—This affair will demand the most serious consideration.—0 Lamesa—Lamesa my darling, my best beloved Child was it possible for you to be so deceived by that artful prince, was it possible to disobey the command of your indulgent father & bring upon our family such wretchedness & dishonour.
Fame with her thousand tongues commenced her pleasing employment—& as swift as the wings of time she wafted the inteligence thro the City with many distorted  &  exagerated particulars—all was astonishment confusion  &  uproar. Resentment enkindled her indignant sparks into a flame—& the general cry was revenge & war. The Sciotan. King was walking in his parlour feeding his imagination with the pleasing prospect of his future glory  &  felicity. I am quoth he to himself, honoured above all the other princes of the empire— & even above the heir apparent to the imperial crown of Ken-tuck. Who could be admited except myself to marry the fair Lamesa, the eldest daughter of the Emperor, the most amiable, the most accomplished & the most honourable Lady in the universe. This is a distinction which will place me on equal ground with the Emperor himself—& command from all my subjects the homage of th^ir highest respect  & reverence—Besides I have a soul that can relish the charms of the beautiful Maid—She will adore me a's her Lord  &  think herself highly honoured  &  exceeding happy to submit to my most endearing <fe affectionate embraces.—But ah mighty Sambal you little thought how soon this delightful prospect would be reversed—& that your soul would be filled with chagrene, indignation & revenge.—A messenger burst into his parlour & announced the astonishing tidings of Lamesa's elopement.—She has absolutely goiie says he to become the wife of Elseon <fe the empress of Kentuck.—Not the tremendous roar of ten thousand thunders  [sporUaneoushj thro^ the atmosphere]
—could have produced greater surprise—His countenace was all amazement—It was for a moment covered with paleness his lips quivered—his kneas smote together & his gigantic body trembled like the shaking of a tower under the effects of an earthquake—But soon  [after a little silent']  his reflections— <fe cogitations caused the blood to return with a tenfold velocity into his face— [it assumed the coulor of redness & dinghing] He assumed the attitude of terrific majesty & poured forth his feelings in a voice more terrible than the roaring of a volcano.—How have I been insulted, abused, dishonoured & outraged. How have my prospects of glory been instantaneously blasted & my character  [becovfie utter]  become the ridicule of a laughing world—What felicities of enjoying the imperial maid in my arms adoring me for her husband are now vanished—And by whom am I thus disgraced, insulted & injured? By the mock prince of Kentuck—an effeminate stripling—a cringing & plausible Upstart. He has robed me of the fairest orniment of my kingdom Lamesa, who was mine by solemn contract— &  must he now revel in her charms, which are mine, & pride himself in those deceitful arts by which he has seduced her & stolen her from my enjoyment. No ungrateful  &  insiduous monster—your triumph shall be of short duration, & this arm shall viset your crimes upon your head with a tenfold vengence—Having poured forth a torrent of the most dreadful imprecations & menaces, he left his parlor, & walked forth to consult his principal officers on the best plan to obtain revenge—
In the meantime, the Emperor less haughty & indignant, & possessed of sentiments more humane & benevolent, sent an invitation to his Councellors to attend him—They were unanimous in the opinion that the offence of Elseon required reparation—But should war be the consequence if he refused to return Lamesa? On this-question, two of the Councellors contended that a humble recantation would repair the injury done to the honour of the imperial family & the authority of
the goverment. The other two insisted— [that would not be suffiaierU]  .that they should demand in addition ten Mammouth which would be an adequate compensation—But they all depricated the horrors of war. In the midst of their debates which were managed with great coolness & impartiality Sambal presented himself. I have come forward says he, may it please your most excellent majesty, to demand the fulfilment of that solemn Contract which you made to deliver me your oldest daughter in marriage—She has b^n surreptitiously carried off by the young prince of Kentuck—She is mine by contract & your majesty is bound to deliver her to me—[J demand']  Let her be immediately demanded,  &  if the Emperor, the father of the young prince shall refuse to return her—this will implicate him in the same crime & be a sufiicient cause of war. In that case war will be indispensible to vindicate the honour of our respective Crowns—& the rights of the Empire. I should then give my voice for war  &  would never sheath my sword until torrents of blood had made an expiation for the ingratitude baseness & perfedy of the young prince—An humble recantation or the delivery of ten mammoth—^would this be a sufficient reparation for an offence so flagitious—so enormous.—No the very proposal would be an insult on the dignity of our goverment—Can any thing short of the repossession of the fair object stolen—of the invaluable prize feloniously taken from us be an adequate compensation— Nothing short of this can heal our bleeding honour—appease the indignation of our subjects, & reinstate friendship & an amicable intercourse between both Empires—Let a refusal be followed by an immediate declaration of war—Let the resources & energies of the nation be called forth—assemble your armies  &  pour destruction upon all who shall oppose the execution of our revenge.—I myself will lead the van & mingle my arm with those who fight the most bloody battles —Heroes shall fall before us—their towns shall be laid in ruins, <fe carnage shall glut our indignant swords.—
When further deliberation had taken place, the Emperor & two of his Counsellors adopted the advice of Sambal  [to demand Lamesa] — &  an Envoy was immediately dispatched to the emperor of Kentuck with the following Letter.
May it please your most gracious Majesty.
Nothing could have given us more pleasure than the disposition you manifested in sending, Elseon the heir apparent to your Crown to viset our family. We treated him as our dearest Cousen & as our most intimate Friend—He was invited to associate with our children & to consider himself whilst he tarried as a member of our family—Such being the confidence we placed in his rectitude & honour, that he assumed the liberty to contract the most intimate acquaintance with Lamesa our eldest daughter—This produced an agreement between them that with our consent they would be united in marriage.—Nothing would have been more pleasing than such a connection. But we found that it would be a most flagrant violation of the true meaning & spirit of our Constitution & an impious outrage on the memory of its great founder.—-For these reasons we signified our pleasure that Elseon would not insist on our compliance with his request.—He appeared to acquiese in our descision—& we afterwards contracted with Sambal, king of Sciota to give her in marriage to him.—But the after conduct of your Son, may it please your most gracious majesty, did not correspond with the high confidence we placed in him.—With deep regret & the most painful sensations we are compelled to declare that he has committed a crime, which has disturbed our peace & happiness, dishonered our family, & outraged the authority of our goverment  &  the rights of our empire.—He  [has]  formed a plan to transport Lamesa into your dominions—To accomplsh this  [he made use of the most insidus arts'] —He took advantage of our clemency  &  con-descention & the high respect we manifested towards him— & without our consent  &  contrary to our will, he has succeeded
[in transporting to the Oity of Gamba] —in his perfiduous design. —Lamesa is doubtless with you in the City of Gamba. A crime of such malignity—committed against the honour & interest of our family, goverment & empire, demands reparation—Your majesty will perceive that the only adequate reparation which can be made—will be, the return of Lamesa
to our dominions We therefore demand that she be conveyed
back with all possible expedition. No other alternative can prevent the interruption of that confidence, friendship & peace which have long continued between both empires—& save them from the horrors & calamities of war.—
Signed.     Rambock,  Emperor of Sciota.
When Hamboon had received this letter, he immediately invited his Councellors to attend him & laid it before them, & as it was a subject of vast importance to the empire he likewise invited his priests  &  principal offercers to join them in council. The various passions appeared to opperate in the course of their consultation. To avoid Hostilities with all its attendant callamities was what they most ardently desired— &  some concluded that if no other alternative could be agreed upon it would be for the interest of the Empire & the best policy to return the princess—but others reprobated this measure as pusilanimous  &  cowardly, & advised, if no other reparation could be received—to retain the princis  &  maintain the conflict with a manly & heroic firmness.—What say they . do not honor & justice require, that we should defend the rights of the imperial Family—If the Sciotan goverment should demand, that we should send them our Emperor or Empress, would not honor impel us to spurn at the demand &  reject it with indignation—Their present demand is as preposterous,  &  as insulting.—No satisfaction will they receive for the supposed injury—except that we should seize the princis of the Empire, tare her from the bosom of her consort & transport her to Sciota—Are we capable of an act so unjust &
inhuman—^so base & disgraceful? As the debates were proceeding, Elseon rose—May I says he claim your attention a moment.—Undaunted by the cruel demand  &  haughty menace of the Sciotan goverment, I am willing to abide your decision —If transporting Lamesa into our dominions, when she has been most unjustly  &  inhumanly demanded for a companion, is a crime  [so perfiduous Scflagidous as\  of such mighty magnitude, then inflict a punishment that shall be adequate to the offence—But if the Almighty whose benevolence is infinite, has designed the union of hands where hearts are united—I have then transgressed no divine law, but have obeyed the divine will—I am therefore innocent of any crime. I have an undoubted right to retain Lamesa for my wife—& no goverment on earth have any authority from heaven to tear her from my bosom.—Nor will I submit to such an event—so long as the life-blood circulates thro' my heart & warms my limbs —If war must be the consequence of my proceedings,  [which transgressed no principles af honour justice or humanity^ we are both innocent ^ honourable, it will give me the most perfect feelings^ I shall deplore it certainly, but will never shrink like a Dastard from the conflict.—The Sciotan King, who is at the bottom of all the mischief shall never behold me fleeing before his gigantic sword or sculking to avoid a single combat with him.—You have therefore no other alternative but either first to slay your prince & then like cowards to send back your princes to Sciota—or else to make immediate preparation to meet their threatened vengences with fortitude and courage. This speach of the young prince united the whole council & they unanimously agreed to reject the demand of the Sciotan goverment. A Letter was written  &  an Envoy dispached with instructions to attempt a reconciliation. He precipitated his journey to the court of Rambock  &  when he arrived he delivered him the following Letter.
May it please your most excellent Majesty.—
Next to the welfare and prosperity of our Empire we should rejoice in the welfare and prosperity of yours. It is therefore with extreme regret that we view the unhappy difference which has arisen,  &  which threatens to involve the two empires in the calamities of war—Had you demanded a. reparation for the supposed injury which would consist with the principles of justice  &  the honour of our crown & gover-ment, it should be given you with the utmost cheerfulness— But to return you Lamesa—who has now become the princis of Kentuck, would be tearing her from the arms of an affectionate Husband & breaking the bond of solemn wedlock— And compliance with your demand will subject us to the commission of such injustice & cruelty, it must therefore be our duty to declare, that we will not return the young princes— And as such an event would destroy her happiness as well as that of her affectionate Consort, we sliall permit her to tarry in our dominions & grant her protection—We are however desirous that an honourable reconciliation may take place^ and a good understanding be restored—To effect this most important and very desirable object, we have given full authority to Labanko our beloved Brother, the Bearer of this Letter, to negociate a settlement of our difference, provided you will receive any thing as a substitute for what you have demanded.—
Signed   Hamboon  Emperor of Kentuck.
The mind of Rambock was not formed for the perpetual exercise of Resentment & malice.—And having conversed a considerable time with Labanco, who appologised for the conduct of the young prince with great inginuety—his anger abated & he felt a disposition for the restoration of friendship —but the indignation & malice of Sambol encreased with time^his dark soul thirsted more ardently for revenge & nothing would satisfy but blood & carnage.    He employed
instruments to assist in fanning the sparks of resentment  & blowing them into the flames of war. Not content to represent facts as they existed—& in their true colours—monstrous stories were fabricated  &  put in cerculation—calculated to excite prejeudice & rouse the resentment of the people against Elsepn <fe the whole empire of Kentuck. He had recourse to a class of men who were denominated prophets & conjurors to favour his disign.—^They had for many ages a commanding influence over the minds of a great majority of the people—As they pretended to have art of investigating the councils & designs of the heavenly Hierachy & to have a knowledge of future events, the people with pleasure listened to their predictions  [with vast pleasure] —& thought it impious to question or or doubt their fulfilment. A small company of these necromancers or juglers assembled on the great square of the City & mounted a stage which was provided for them.—The Citizens attended. It was a prodigious concourse of all classes, of all descriptions, both wise  &  simple* both male & female.—They surrounded the stage and were all attention, all anxious to learn the hiden decrees of Heaven, &  the future destinies of the empire.—Drafolick their chief prophet extended his arms  &  cast up his eyes towards Heaven. Quoth he—Heaven unfolds her massy gates  &  opens to my view a prospect, wide  &  vast—The seven sons of. the great Spirit sieze their glittering swords & swear they shall not be sheathed till blood in torrents run  &  deluge the fair land of Kentuck I behold enemies martialing on the celestial plain —& hear warriors  &  heroes cry—avenge the crime of Elson —I hear a thundering voice proceeding from the great Throne of him who rules the world—proclaiming thus— corn shall not grow on the Sciotan fields, nor mamouth yield their milk—nor fish be taken in the snare but pestilence shall roam—unless Sciota shall avenge the crime of Elseon. Drofalik ended his prophesy—Hamack then arose & in his hand he held a stone which he pronounced  transparent—
tho' it was not transparent to common eyes.—Thro' this he could view things present & things to come—could behold the dark intrigues & cabals of foreign courts—& discover hidden treasures, secluded from the eyes of other mortals. He could behold the galant & his mistress in their bed chamber & count all their moles warts & pimples. Such was the clearness of his sight when this transparent stone was placed before his eyes. He looked fiercely & steadfastly on the stone  &  raised his prophetick voice.—I behold Hamboon with all his priests  &  great officers assembled around him— with what contempt^he declares he dispises all the Sciotans— they are says he cowards & paltroons—they dare not face my brave warriors—Here I see four men coming forward bearing an immage formed with all the fetures of ugliness and deformity—This they call Sambal—the King of Sciota—The whole company break forth into boisterous laughing—Ah see &  they are cutting off his head with their swords yes—and are now kicking it about the palace—Here is a pole it is stuck upon that and carried thro' the City.—0 my loving sparks Elseon  &  Lamesa—what makes you so merry—why Elseon says he has outwitted the Sciotans—he has got the prize & he little regards their resentment.—Hamack was proceeding with such nonsensical visions when the multitude interrupted him with a cry—Revenge Revenge—We will convince the Ken-tuckans that we are not cowards or poltroons—Their heads shall pay for their sport in kicking about the pretended head of our beloved King.—We will avenge the crime of Elseon— The great and good Being is on our side,  &  threatens us with famine  &  pestilence unless we avenge the crime of Elseon.

The arts of these Conjurers were the consummation of Sambal's plan, to produce in the minds of the multitude an inthusiasm & rage for war.—He now repairs to the Emperor &  solicits him to assemble his councellors immediately proclaim war & concert measures for its prosecution. The Emperor  replies,  that they  should   soon   be   assembled—
But as to war it was a subject which required great consideration.—
Early on the next day his councellors, priests & principal officers all meet him in the council Room—He laid before them the letter of Hamboon—& observed, that tho' the gov-erment of Kentuck had refused to return Lamesa—yet they had offered to make to our goverment a recantation of Elseon's crime & to pay us almost any sum as a reparation for our injury.—The council sat silent for some time-^at length the venerable Boakim arose.—I must beg, says he. the indulgence of your Majesty & this honourable council a few moments—Never did I rise with such impressions of the high importance of our deliberations as what I now feel—The great question to be decided is peace or war—If peace can be preserved with honour—then let us maintain peace— but if not, then let us meet war with fortitude & courage.—As to the. great crime of Elseon, no one presumes to present an apology —Even their own goverment by .offering to make reparation implicitly aknowledge that he has been guilty of a crime.— But is it of such malignity as to require the conflagration of towns  &  cities & the lives of milions to make an expiation.— ICanno other reparation consistent with justice & humanity be received] —Or must we  [compel]  in order to have an atonement made for the crime of Elseon, compel the goverment of Ken-tuck to commit another crime, to separate, to tear from each other's embraces the husband & wife.—Such a reparation as this we cannot in justice expect.—Shall we then accept of no other?—Cannot our bleeding honour be healed without shed-ing blood—without laying a whole empire in ruins.—Such refined notions of honour may prove our own ruin, as well as the ruin of those on whom we attempt to execute vengence— The calamities of war have a reciprocal action on the parties, each must expect to endure a portion of evils—how large a portion would fall to our share, in case of war, it is not for us to determine—While thirsting for revenge, we contemplate
with infinite pleasure, their armies routed  &  their warriors bleeding under orfr swords—their helpless women & children expiring by thousands & their country in flames—But reverse the scene—suppose the enemy have as much wit as much stratagem courage strength  &  inhumanity as what ve possess, &  such may be our situation, when the flood gate is once opened, who can stop the torrent & prevent devastation & ruin—[Wie  ought therefore']  It was never designed by the great & good Being that his children should contend  &  destroy that existence which he gave them—They all have equal rights—& ought to strive to maintain peace & friendship— This has been the maxim of our fathers & this the doctrine taught by the great founder of our goverment & religion— Under the influence of this maxim our nation has grown to an emence multitude—& contentment  &  happiness have been universal.—But why can we not enjoy peace with honour?— what insurmountable obsticles are then to prevent.— [Why iruely, a recantation ^ 'property are no compensation for the injury?    For other offences  these  are  accepted — ^ why must
the offence of Elseon be singular  ]
The Emperor's daughter we presume is happy—nor can it be a disgrace to the imperial family that she has married the son of an Emperor, the heir apparent to his crown— [-Bm^ she was to have been the wife of Sambol the King of Sciotaf] We can therefore with honour to our goverment accept of the reparation offered—& thus preserve the blessings of peace. But if we suffer- resentment, pride & ambition to plunge us into a war—where will its mischief—where will its miseries end—As both empires are nearly equal as to number & resources I will venture to predict their eventual overthrow & destruction.
Boakim would have proceeded,—but Hamkol rose  &  interrupted—It was impudence in the extreme—but he had much brass & strong lungs—& would be heard further than Boakim. —Such sentiments says he may comport with the infirmities

of age—but they are too degrading & cowardly for the vigor and youth of manhood—If we suffer insult, perfedy & outrage to pass of with impunity—we may afterwards bend our necks to be trpden upon by every puny upstart & finical coxcomb— No—let us march with our brave warriors into the dominion of Hamboon.   His eflFeminate & luxurious Court will tremble at our presence & yield the fair Lamesa into our possession— But if they should still have the temerity to refuse—we will then display our valour by inflicting upon them a punishment which their crimes deserve — Yes our valiant varriors shall gain immortal renown by their heroic exploits: [^   by the destruction of all shall who,']    Sciota will ever after have the preeminence over Ken tuck—& compel her haughty sons to bow in our presence—Let war be proclaimed—& every kingdom & tribe from the River to the Lakes will pour forth their warriors anxious  to  revenge our country's wrongs.-^Scarce had he done speaking—And Lakoon the High Priest arose— [fie  was in the interest of Sambal ^ had married his sister.   He had taken great umbrage at Elseon for saying that the priesthood had too great an assendence of the court of Bambock!] —And lifting up his sanctamoneous eyes slowly towards heaven  & extending his  [^righf]  reverend hand a little aboye an horizontal position he spoke—When the Laws which are contained in our holy religion are transgressed, it is my duty as high Priest of the empire to give my testimony against the transgression—Elseon, the heir apparent to the imperial throne of Kentuck has been guilty of Robery & impiety within our dominions—He has robed  this empire   of  an   invaluable treasure & as this crime is a most flagicious transgression of our divine Law—it must have been commited in defiance of the high authority of Heaven—& therefore it is an act of the greatest impiety.   The injury, the insult & outrage has not been eommited against us alone—if this was the case perhaps we might accept of reparation—but it commited against the throne of omnipotence & in defiance of his authority.—
No reparation can of consequence be received except it be a return of the stolen treasure—or the Blood of the Transgressor—nothing else can satisfy the righteous demand of the Great & good Being—He therefore calls upon the civil power to execute his vengeance—to inflict an exampleary punishment—and as it is his cause—& you are imployed as his instruments you may be assured that his almighty arm will add strength to your exertions & give you a glorious victory over your enimies—The mighty atcheivments of your warriors shall immortalize their names—& their heads shall be crowned with never fading laurels—& as for those who shall die, gloriously fighting in the cause of their country & their God, they shall immediately receive etherial Bodies—& shall arise quickly to the abodes of increasing delight and glory—He said no more—he had discharged some part of his* malice against Elseon for saing, that the priesthood had too much influence in the court of Rambock—
The door was opened & it was seen that Sambal, at the head of a great multitude of citizens had taken their stand in front of the house- all crying with a loud voice—Revenge & war—Long live the Emperor & King—We will avenge their wrongs: This uproar, & the harang of the High Priest determined the wavring mind of the Emperor.— [J5m<  the venerable Boakim ^ Bithawan opposed the torrent  [^  stood as stood firm,'\ 7 hey boldly affirmed that a war was impolitic ^ unjustifiable — But \they\ Iheir opposition however was vain — The popular voice was against them —^  the other two councellors — Hamkol ^ Gamasko \_gave their vote for war^ — urged with great vehemence that war should be declared, —]
In vain were all the reasonings of the venerable Boakim & Bithawan—The other two councillors Hamkol, & Gamasko joining the Emperor they proceeded to make out a declaration of  War —It was in these words—   »
War is declared by the goverment & empire of Sciota
»   80   THE   "manuscript   FOUND."
against the govermcnt & empire of Kentuck—The Sciotans are required to exterminate, without distinction of age or sex all the inhabitants of the empire of Kentuck—they are required to bum their houses, & either to destroy, or to take possession of their property for their own use & benefit. This destruction is commanded by the great benevolent Spirit & by the goverment of Sciota.
Signed   Rambock  Emperor of Sciota.
A copy of this declaration was given to Labano the brother & evoy of Hamboon—He demanded a guard to defend him against the rage of the common people—who discovered a disposition to plunge their swords into the heart of every man, whose fortune it was to be born on the opposite side of the Riv^r—Labanco was garded as far as the River & conveyed across in safety—He repaired to Gamba, [^  there he proclaimed the intelligence of this declaration of War.'\ &  there made known all the proceedings of the Sciotan goverment.
Here one leaf of the manuscript, pages 133 and 134, appear to be missing.   Page 135 proceeds as follows:
Habelon, King of Chiango was the next proud chief who appeared at Galanga with a chosen band of warriors. He had fifteen thousand who boasted of superior strength & agility— Their countenances were fierce & bold, being true indications of their hearts which feared no danger—They were always obedient to the order of their king who always sought the most conspicuous place for the display of his valour—Possessed of gigantic strength & of astonishing agility he was capable of performing the most briliant acheivments which would almost exceed belief—His mind was uncultivated by science & his passions' were subject to no restraint—His resentment was quick & firy & his anger knew no bounds  Ifor expression'] — Nothing was concealed in his heart—whether friendship or
enmity—but always exhibited by expressions strong & extravagant.—He had a soul formed for war—In the bustle of campaigns, in the sanguine field where heroes fell beneath his conquering sword, his ambition was gratafied & he acquired the highest martial glory.
Ulipoon King of Michegan received the orders of the Emperor with great joy—War suited his nigardly & avaricious soul—^as he was in hope^ to obtain great riches from the spoils of the Enimy—Little did he regard the miseries & destruction of others if by this means he could obtain wealth & agrandize himself—A mind so contracted & selfish was not capable of imbibing one sentiment of generosity or humanity—or even of honour—None however were more boistrous than he for war—None proclaimed their own valour with so loud a voice—yet none were more destitute of courage & more capable of treachery, baseness & cruelty—Yet with the sounding epithets of patriotism, honour  &  valour—he proceeded with great expedition to collect a chosen band of [dauntless warriors — the consisted of]  Eighteen thousand wariors.—Their marshial appearance intittled them to a commander of more generosity & valour, than the nigardly & treacherous Ulipoon.
Numapon, the King of Colorangus  [made no]  was prompt to comply with the imperial Requisition. Tho' he prefered the scenes of peace—& Being very fond of study & of the mechanical arts his mind was replenished with knowledge & he took great pleasure in promoting works of inginuity. He was farmed for  [great]  wisdom &  [subteliy]  penetration of mind, was capable of forming great plans & of prossecuting^ them with vigor & perseverance—He was deliberate & circumspect in all his movements  [but was always quicky on any suden emmergencCf to concert plans ^ to determine] —had the full command of his mental powers in every situation—& even when dangers surrounded him would instantly deter-mine the best measures to be pursued. He prefered the scenes
7
of peace—^but could meet war with courage & firmness.—^At the head of a select band of sixteen thousand men, all com-pleatly armed & anxious to meet the foe he marched to join the grand army. Not far behind appeared Ramuck the King of Geneseo—[  With"]  Furious & resolute, he had made the utmost expedition to collect his forces—Nor did he delay a moment, when his men were collected & prepared to move— At the head of ten thousand bold & robust warriors he appeared at the place of general rendesvos within one day after the King of Colorongus had arived.—He hosted of the rapidity of his movements & tho' he commanded the smalest division of the grand army, yet he anticipated distinguished laurels of glory—not less than what would be obtained by their first commander.
When these Kings with their forces had all arrived atTal-anga, the Emper Rambock ordered them to parade on a great plain. They obeyed and were formed in solid coUums. The Emperor, then, attended by his son Moonrod, his Councellors & the high Priest, presented himself before them—His garments glitered with ornaments—& a bunch of long feathers of various colours were placed on the front of his Cap. His sword he held in his right hand, and being tall and strait in his person, & having a countenance grave  &  bold, when he walked his appearance was majestic. He was the commander in chief—& such was the high esteem & reverance with which the whole army viewed him, that none were considered as being so worthy of that station. Taking a stand in front of the army, he brandished his sword—All fixed their eyes upon him & gave profound attention.—He thus made an address.— Brave warriors. It is with the greatest satisfaction <6 joy that I now behold you assembled to avenge the most flagitious crimes, of which man was ever guilty.—Ingratitude  &  perfedy, seduction, Robery & the most daring impiety against heaven have been perpetrated within our dominions—^The young prince of Kentuck is the monster, whose has been guilty of
these Crimes—Our most amiable daughter Lamesa he has seduced & contrary to our will has transported her into his own country—wishing to avoid the eflfusion of human blood we oflfered to withhold our revenge if the Emperor of Kentuck would restore our Daughter. But he has refused—He has implicated himself & all his subjects in the horrid crimes of his son—Their whole land is now guilty—& every man woman & child are the proper objects of severe chastisement. —The great & good Being is indignant towards them, [^  views them with the utmost detestation & abhorrance'] —As we have received our power from him he requires, that we should not only avenge our own wrongs, but likewise execute his veng-ence on those perfiduous ingrates & monsters,  [of wickedness <f  impiety] —That this is his divine will has been clearly investigated by our holy prophets & priests—who have given us the most  [indubitaC]  positive assurance that success shall attend our arms—that we shall be enriched with the plunder of our enimies—that laurels of immortal fame will crown the achiev-ments of our warriors~& that they shall be  [gloriously]  distinguished on the plains of glory like Suns & Stars in the jBrmement of heaven—Our cause is just—the celestial powers above are on our side—they have brandished their swords & sworn—that blood shall deluge the fair Land of Kentuck. You have done well my brave warriors, that you have assembled around the standard of your Emperor—I will conduct you to the field of Battle & direct your movements—My son Moonrod, whose arm like mine is not enfebled by age, will mingle with the boldest combatants & lead you on to victory. —By the most valorous exploits by blood <6.slaughter we will convince our enimies that we are not cowards & poltroons— Their ridecule and derision shall be turned into mourning & lamentation—& we will teach their effeminate & luxurious Goverment not to dispise the hardy & brave sons of Sciota. In full confidence that we shall gloriously triumph—& add immortal lustre to our names, we will now march forward—
[we wiir] &  avenge the injuries done to the honour of our imperial goverment & the rights of our epipire—& all the celestial beings above shall rejoice in the execution of divine vengence. He said no more—the whole army with one voice proclaimed—Long live the Emperor—We swear that he shall never find us cowards & poltroons. The Emperor then ordered them to march by divisions  &  each King to lead on his own subjects. They began their march towards the land of Kentuck—Their provisians & baggage were born on the backs of Mammouth—Each man had a sword by his side & a spear in his hand—& on their breasts down to their hips & on their thighs they wore pieces of mamouth skins to guard them from arrows & the weapons of death—&  oji  their Caps they wore bunches of long feathers. Their garments were short, so as not to encumber them in battle.—^Thus equipt & orni-mented they moved on in exact order until they arived at the great River—Here they halted to provide boats to transport them across—Their baggage & provisions were carried on the backs of their mammouth which carrid prodigious loads.— And here we will leave them for the present & take a view of the proceedings at Kentuck.—
When Labanco had presented to Hamboon the Emperor of Kentuck the declaration of war & related the proceedings of the Sciotan goverment, he immediately assembled his Coun-cellors, who unanimously agreed to make the most active & vigorous preparation for war.—The Emperor sent forth his mandates to all the princes of his empire requiring them to assemble the most couragious warriors in their respective kingdoms, & to march to the City of Gamba.—All the princes of the empire were quick to obey the requisition of their Sovereign. The army assembled and paraded on a great plain before the City—Hamboon attended by his two sons, Elseon & Hanock & by his councellors & three of his principal Priests walked out of the City & presented himself before his army. —His garments were of various colours & his cap was adorned
with a bunch of beautiful Feathers, which waved high in the wind—In his left hand he held a spear & in his right a sword —His countenance was bold & resolute—& such was his gracefulness & elocution, when he spoke, that all eyes were iSxed upon him & all ears were attention.
My brave Sons says he, I extremely regreted the necessity of calling you from your peaceable employments to engage in the blody scenes of war—But such is the violence the malice & ambition of the Sciotan goverment that nothing will satisfy them but hostilities between the empires—They have proclaimed war, even a war of extermination against our dominions—Nor was it in our power to prevent this most dreadful calamity unless   we   tore   assunder   the   bond   of  wedlock betwen the prince and the princis of the Empire & transported her like a culprit into their dominions.   This was the only alternative which they offered to accept to prevent this terrible crisis—& why the vigor of this demand—Was it because the young prince had violated any Law either human or divine— No—it was because the King of Sciota had fallen in love with the princis—& wished to have her for his wife—But as she viewed him with the utmost hatred & disgust, he has been disappointed—To gratify his malice & revenge he has roused the Sciotans to take arms & threatens to deluge our cities with the blood of our citizens & to' lay our country in ruins.    It is a war on their part to gratify malice & revenge—& nothing will satisfy their malignant passions but our complete extermination—On our part it is a war of self defence—of self preservation—a defence which will extend to our wives & our children & to all the blessings & endearments of life.   We must either submit to behold  [our dearest friends expiring in agonieSj~\  our property torn from us, our houses in flames—& our dearest friends expiring in agonies, & like cowards suffer them without resistance to cut our own throats,—or we must meet them like men determined to vindicate our rights—& to retaliate all their intended mischief.   Nor need we fear the
event of the contest—Infinite benevolence will regard our situation, & grant us that assistance which will give success to our efforts—You my brave sons will be inspired with courage—Your hands will be strong for the Battle & their warriors will fall before you like corn before the repers sickel —With all their mighty boasting, & high confidence in superior cunnig & prowes—they are men formed of the same material which we possess—Our swords will find a passage to their hearts—& the vital blood gushing forth, they will fall prostrate at our feet. Let us march then with courage to meet the implacable foe—determined either to die gloriously fighting—or to obtain victory.—
Having thus spoken—The whole army, with a loud voice, replied—Victory or death—Lead us on to victory. At the head of this army, which consisted of one hundred & fifty thousand men, he marched towards the great River—They arrived on the Bank & beheld the Sciotans, all busily employed in making preparation to cross the River.
The Empress—the princis Lamesa, & the Emperors daughters attended by a few friends & their servants; arived at theplace where the army was encaped—As soon as Elseon heard the news of their arival, he hastened to the place, & found the company had alighted  [at an house]  & that Lamesa &  her friend Holiza were in a room by themselves—As soon as he entered Lamesa arose—The gloom & anxiety which for a number of days were visible in her countenance, at his appearance were dispelled—He received her into his arms with an affectionate embrace—& expressed the greatest pleasure at seeing her once more. The tears ran down his cheeks —for a moment she was silent—She raised her head & replied T-0 Elseon were it not for you I should be the most wretched being in existence & yet my love for you has been the cause of all my present affliction.—If I never had seen you, those horrid prospects which now present themselves to my view, would never have been—But you* are innocent—nor am I
guilty of any crime. But how can I endure to behold the calamities which must fall upon both nations in consequence of our connection?—Two empires at war, spreading carnage & ruin—warriors bleeding on the field of Battle—^innocent women & children screiching in the agonies of death— & towns & cities in flames—Ah horrid prospect—Have you & I my dear Elseon produced these dreadful calamities?  [Is our conduct the cause which must']  We are not, says he my dear Lamesa, responsible for the horrid effects of malice & revenge, which may be occationed by our innocent conduct. If men will be so indignant towards each other, because we do right as, to massacre & do all the mischief they can, we may deplore their weakness & depravity—but have no more reason, to make ourselves unhappy on the account, than if these effects were by some other cause—They alone are responsible for their crimes—& have reason for unhappy reflections.—
But how can I endure says she, to behold my dearest friends, become each others implacable enimy ? To see them mutually engaged to destroy each others life?—My Father, for whom I ever had the greatest affection—& my only Brother are now at the head of one hostile army—And your Father & you my dearest husband are at the head of the other— When these armies meet would you not plunge your sword into the heart of my father & my brother— &  would they not do the same by you if in their power? When such scenes present themselves to my view they pierce my soul like dagers —& produce the keenest anguish—0 that I could fly to my Father, & on my bended knees implore forgiveness. Yes says Elseon, & when you have done that, he will give you to the mighty Sambol for his wife—
No never, says she, never would I submit—I abhor the monstre more than ever—He is the most malignant scoundrel in existance—To gratify his revenge whole empires must be laid in ruins. What punishment more just than that he himself should fall in battle, & endure the agonies which his
vengful soul is bringing on others.—But as for my father  & my brother, they have, by his artifices been deceived—I conjure you, if you have any regard for my happiness, not to take their lives if in your power.
Their lives says he are safe from my sword—Rather that my hands should be stained with the blood of your dearest friends I will present my bosom to their swords—But hark— there is an alarm—An express arived  &  informed him, that the Sciotan army had found means to get their Boats down the River in the night unperceived— &  had landed, without opposition, about three miles below the Kentuckian encampment.—Elseon then embraced his wife & said, when your protection & my honour call, I must obey.—He left her in tears imploring heaven to protect him— &  running swiftly to the army he took his station.
CHAP—XIV—
Hamboon mounted on an eligant Horse richly caparo-soned, rode thro' the encampment-^proclaiming aloud every man to his station, seize your arms & prepare for battle—All his princes quick to obey their commander, instantly repaired to their respective divisions—& gave orders to form the men into solid columns—When this was done—they marched a small distance & paraded on the great plain of Geheno—They were now prepared for the hostile engagement—Their ofl&cers of the highest Ranks marched along in front of their divisions — &  by their speaches inspired the men with boldness & courage—They ardently wished to behold their enemies— & to have an opportunity of displaying their valour in their destruction. Hamboon then commanded his principal officers to assemble around him—When they were collected, which
was in front of the army, he then addressed them.—I wish for your opinion, my brave
Here a leaf (pages 148  A  144) of the Manasoript is missing.   Page 145 proceeds as follows:
<& heroic Commanders, had each a chosen band of warriors, who were ordered as soon as the battle should begin, to march between the divisions, & charge the enimy,  \in order to break their order & throw them into confusion'] —The design of this arangement was to break the Ranks & throw them into confusion. The command of these bands were given to Elseon, Labanko, Hanock, & two counsellors of the Emperor Hamul & Taboon.—The momentous period had arived—Each grand Army were now ready—were anxious for the combat, <fe sanguine in their expectations of obtaining a glorious victory.— Musicians with instruments of various kinds, were now playing thro' every division of both armies—They blowed horns, pipes & a kind of Trumpet—& beat with sticks on little tubs whose heads were formed of parchment.—The melody .was truely martial  &  calculated to inspire each warrior with an ardent desire for battle & the most daring heroism—All was husht—The musicians fell back in the rear—There was a perfect silence thro' both armies.—Each Emperor with their swords brandishing were in front & facing their respective armies. Near three hundred thousand spears were glittering with the reflection of sun beams—Not a cloud to be seen in the east—The sun shone with his usial brightness—In the west a dark cloud began to arise & distant thunder was heard to rumble.—Rambock proclaimed with a voice which was heard from the right to the left—March—march, my brave warriors— &  fight like heroes.—Hamboon saw them beginning to move— but not changing his countenance which was placid & bold— he proclaimed—Stand firm, my brave sons—Let your arrows fly thick against your enimies as they advance—& finish with
your spears & your swords their destruction.—The musick again played & both armies gave a tremendous shout— ^Spears & swords]  When the Sciotans had advanced, with a firm & moderate step, within a small distance of Hamboons army, both armies discharged arrows with such unerring aim  & celerity, that many brave warriors on both sides fell prostrate —others were sorely wounded & retired back in the rear— Their places were immediately supplied & the second Rank colosed  &  took their stations in the fight—Each man fixing his spear horizontaly & about as high as his breast, the Sciotans rushed forward with hedious yels  &  horrible shouting <?made a most tremendous, & furious charge upon the Kentucks— They received them with firmness & courage—Spears met spears —many were bent and broken—& others were thrust, on both sides into bodies of Heroes, whose blood gushing forth, they fell with horrid groans, pale & lifeless on the sanguine plain. Neither army gave back but being nearly equal as to strength & numbers they poured forth upon each other with a lavish hand the implements of death  &  destruction—
. Determined to conquer or die, it was impossible to conjecture which Emperor would have gained the victory had the divisions or bands in the rear of each army remained inactive. But anxious to engage with the boldest warriors, the Kentuck-Bands, led on by their heroic princes, rushed between the division of the grand army  &  made a most furious charge upon the Sciotans—They broke thro' their Ranks—peircing with deadly wounds their indignant foes—heroes fell before them— & many of the Sciotans being struck with surprise & terror began to retire back—But the bands in the rear of their army instantly rushed forward & met their furious combitants—The battle was now spread in every direction. Many valiant chiefs who commanded under their respective Kings were overthrown —& many thousand robost  &  brave warriors, whose names were not distinguished by oflftce, were compeled to receive deadly wounds & to bite the dust.—It was Elseon fortune to
attack the division led by the valiant RamofF—He broke his ranks & killed many warriors—while driving them furiously before him—he met Hamkol at the head of many thousand Sciotans—Hamkol beheld the young Prince & knew him  & being fired with the greatest rage & thirst for revenge, he urged on the combat with the most daring violence Now he thot, was a fiavorable chance to gain immortal renown—Elseon says he shall feel the effects of my conquering sword—The warriors on both side charged each other with incredible fury —& Elseon & Hamkol met in the center of their divisions—I have found you says Hamkol perfiduous monster—^^I will teach you to rob our empire of its most valuable treasure—He spoke & Elseon replied—Art thou Hamkol the Counsellor of Rambock Your advice has produced this blood and slaughter —Hamkol raised his sword & had not Elseon defended himself from the blow, he never would have spoken again—But quick as the lightning Elseon darted his sword thro' his heart — [Hamkot]  knashed his teeth together &  [with a groan]  tumbling headlong with a groan expired.—
The battle raged—Labaiiko attacked the division of Sambal — His conquering sword had killed two daring chiefs— &  his Band performed the most brilliant exploits —Sambol met him & like an indignant panther, he sprang upon him, & wHile Labanko was engaged in combat with another chief, Sambol thurst his sword into his side—Thus Labanko fell lamented & beloved by all the subjects of the empire of Kentuck— [Hanock']  His learning wisdom & penetration of mind—his integrity, firmness & courage had gained him universal respect & given him a commanding influence over the Emperor & his other Coun-cellors—He was viewed with such respect & reverence, that the death of no man could have produced more grief & lamentation—& excited in the minds of the Kentucks a more ardent thirst for revenge.—The officers of his phalanx exclaimed revenge the death of Labanko—Even lightning could  not
have produced a more instantaneous effect.—With tenfold rage & fury his warriors maintained the conflict & redubled their efforts in spreading death & carnage—The mighty Sam-bal trembled at the slaughter of his  Imbjeds]  warriors & began to dispair of victory— [he began to]  fearing that his intended revenge was turning upon his own head.—During this slaughter of Sambals forces Hanock was engaged in battle with Habelan King of Chianga—No part of the war raged with more a equal balance—Warriors met warriors with such equal strength  &  courage that it was impossible to determine on which side was the greatest slaughter—even their heroic chiefs prudently avoided a combat with each other & emploid their swords in overthrowing those of less distinction, the field was covered with the bodies of heroes, besmeared with blood, which was spread thick on every side.—In the meantime Hamul  &  Taboon who led on the other reserved bands of the Kentucks were fiercely engaged in spreading the war thro' the ranks of the Sciotans—Hamul compelled the division commanded by Sabamah to fall back—but still they fought, as  they slowly retreated—& being reinforced by a body of troops in their rear they continued the conflict  &  maintained their position—The slaughter was emence  &  each party boabted of the most brilliant atchievments.—
Taboon made his attack on the division of Ulipoon commanded by Hamelick—The Sciotan ranks were broken & they must have fled in confusion had not Rameck supported them with his warlike band—The contest now became  [bloody] furious—& equal feats of valour were displaied by contending heroes. The thirsty earth was overspread with the dead  & dying bodies of thousands & saciated its thirst by copious draughts of human blood—Hamelick himself was slain— But not, until after his sword was crimsoned with the blood of his enimies.
The dubious war appeared at last determined—Hambock beheld his army giving ground on every part—He   rode
through their divisions & endeavoured to inspire them with persevering courage—But in vain they could not withstand the impetuosity, the numbers & strength of their Enimies—aided by the advantage they had obtained by the arangement  {they had made]  to manage the conflict—The Sciotans began to retreat—& such was the situation of both armies that  [they] the Sciotans must  [have]  principally have been overthrow & destroyed if the Kentucks had been pennited to continue the havock  &  slaughter th^y had begun. But how often are the most sanguine expectations disappointed by the decrees of Heaven?—At this awful period—whilst the atmosphere was replete with the multifarious sounds of the clashing of swords & spears—the melody of  [the]  martial musick—the shouts of the conquerors & the shrieks f& groans of the dying, even then the heavens were overspread with clouds of the most sable hue, which had blown from the west—The thunders roared tremendously—& the flashes of hightning were incessant. The wind began to blow from the west with great violence— the hail poured down from the clouds & was carried with great velocity full in the faces of the Kentucks—They were unable to see their enimy or continue the pursuit.—Rambock & his princes immediately railed their retreating forces, & facing round encouraged them to fight courageously since the great & good Being had miraculously interposed in their behalf. The Kentuck army were unable to continue the conflict.—They were obliged in their turn, to retreat. But such was the violence of the storm that the Sciotans could not take any great advantage of the confusion of their armies—They however pursued them to the hill which had been in the rear of the Kentucks—overthrowing & kiling some in the pursuit. —But as the hill was overspread with trees which broke the violence of the wind, Hamboon commanded his men to face their pursuers—The Sciotans finding that their enimies had the advantage of the ground  [& being intolerably fatigued with a battle which had lasted near four hours,]  retired a small distance
back—& as soon as the storm abated they marched beyond the ground which was strewed thick with the slain.— [Thus ended the great battle on the plains of Geheno] —There they encamped—and as the storm had now subsided both armies proceeded to make provision to refresh themselves, being nearly exhausted by the fatigues of a most bloody contest which had lasted nearly five hours. That day aflfbrded them no time to bury their dead—The Sun did not tarry in his course but hid himself below the Horizon & darkness spread itself over the face of the earth—The warriors with their spears in their hands extended themselves upon the earth, & spent the night in rest & sleep—Next morning they arose with renovated vigor. Their tho'ts were immediately turned to the sanguine field—Many warriors say they lie there, pierced with mortal wounds & covered with blood—Their spirits have assumed etheriel bodies  &  they are now receiving the rewards assigned to the brave on the plains of glory—but they demand of us that we should secure their remains from the voracious jaws of carniverous Beasts, by interring them in the. earth. But how can this be done unless both armies will mutually agree to lay down their arms during the interment of the remains of their respective warriors. Hamboon dis-pached a Messenger to Rambock, who agreed to an armistice for the term of two days & that ten thousand men might be employed from each army in burying the dead.—
It was indeed a meloncoUy day.—The contest was not desided—Neither army had gained a victory or had reason to boast of any superior advantages obtained or any heroic atcheivments, which were not matched by contending warriors. An emence slaughter was made. Near one hundred thousand were extended breathless on the field—This was only the beginning of the war—& what must be its dreadfiil calamities if it should continue to rage—if a few more battles should be faught & the infuriated Conqueror should turn his vengfiil sword, against defencless women & children & mingle their
blood with the blood of heroes, whp had fallen bravely fighting in their defence. 'When both armies viewed the emence slaughter that had been made of their respective friends— instead of cooling their ardor for the war, it only served to encrease their malice & their thirst for revenge.—
ITen thousand menfrcmi each army, witlwut arms, marched to the field were the battle was faught—& having selected the dead bodies of their respective warriors — they carried \them'] as many of them together as what could be done with convenience — & then digging into the grownd about three feet deep & throwing the dirt around in a circular form upon the edge of the grave — they then deposited the bodies in it, covering the ground over which they had dug with the bodies — & then placing others upon them until the whole were deposited — they then proceeded to thro' dirt upon them to raise over them a high mound — In this manner they proceeded untU tftey had finished the interment. The bodies of the Chiefs thai were slain, were carried to their respective armies — & performing many customary soUemnities of woe, they were intered & prodigious mounds of earth were raised over them. — After the funeral rites were finished & the armistice had expired, the hostile Emperors must now determine on their further plans of operation^
The field was widely strewed, & in many places thickly covered with human bodies—extended in various positions— on their sides their backs & faces— [some with their arms & legs widely spread some with their mouths open & eyes stairing^ —mangled with swords spears & arrows & besmeared with blood & dirt— Most hedious forms & dreadful to behold! Such objects excited horroy & all the sympethetic & compassionate feelings of the human heart.—
As both Emperors had agreed to the suspension of arms for the purpose of burying the Remains of those [0/  the"]  heroic warriors ten thousand men from each army entered the field & began the mournful employment—They dug holes about three feet deep & in a circular form  &  of about twenty or thirty feet diameter.    In these they deposited the bodies of
their deceased heroes & then raised over them large mounds of earth—The bodies of the chiefs who had fallen were carried to their respective armies & buried, with all the soUemnities of woe—over them they raised prodigious mounds of earth— which will remain for ages, as monuments to commemorate the valiant feats of these heroes of the great Battle of Geheno. —After the funeral Rites were finished—& the armistice had expired, the hostile Emperors must now determine on further plans of operation
Rambock requested the advice of his principal ofl&cers, who were unanimous in opinion, that it was their best policy to retire back  [to retire back']  to the hill which was opposite to the place where they landed—& there wait for reinforcements. This they eflfected the jiext night without being perceived by their 4inimy.—Hamboon the next day marched towards them—but not thinking it good policy to attack them at present, took possession of a hill in plain view of the Sciotans & there encamped with his whole army.
As the Sciotans sallied out in parties to plunder & to ravage the country, these were pursud, overtaken or met by parties of the Kentucks—Many bloody skirmishes ensued with various success & many feats of heroism were displaid on both sides. Wherever the Sciotans marched devastation attended their steps—& all classes of people without distinction of age or sex, who fell into their hands became the victims of their infuriated malice—The extermination of the Kentucks appeared to be their object, not considering that it might soon be their turn to have such horrid cruelties retaliated upon them with a three-fold vengence. They likewise had a further object in view, which was to provoke Ham-boon to attack the main army, whilst posted in an advantageous situation.—But it was Hamboon's policy by placing garrison in diflferent stations & by patroling parties to prevent the Sciotans from plundering & destroying his town—& from geting provisions from his country—& in this way to compel
them to cross tbe River or to attajk his army in the position he had taken. "While^the two Emperors were thus manoever-ing—& seeking by various arts & stratigems to gain advantage over each other, a very extraordinary  [instance of heroism & the display of the most rnicere & ardent friendship transpired which is worthy a place on the historic page^] —instance transpired of heroism and friendship—In the dominions of Ham-boon .there lived two young men who were bred in the same vilage—^Having minds formed for the exercise of the noblest principles & possessed of congenial tempers they early contracted the greatest intimacy, & formed, toward each other the strongest attachment.—They joined the standard of Hamboon & in the great battle of Geheno they faught side by side & performed exploits equally bold and heroic.—They eat at the same board & drank of the same cup—& in all their excursions they attended each other & walked hand in hand.—-As these two friends were seting in their tent one evening— Thelford who was the oldest says to Hamkien something whispers me; that this night we can perform a most brilliant exploit—The Sciotans have held a great festival & until midnight they will be emploied i^ music & dancing* & in various diversions—Being greatly fatigued, when they lie down to rest, their sleep will be sound—We may then enter their camp [by slyly geting round their by their c&ntineC]  unperceived & make arltQost dreadful slaughter.—Your plan, replied Hamkien, is excellent, it is worthy the character of an hero.—I will join you—& will either triumph with you in the success of the enterprise or perish in the attempt. Perhaps we may atcheive a glorious deliverance to our country, by destroying our cruel enimies; They both taking their swords and tomehauks repaired towards the camp of the Sciotans in order to reconoi-ter & find where they could enter & not be perceived by the centinals—The Moon shone bright but would set about three 0 clock in the Morning—this was the time they had fixed upon to begin the massacre of their enimies—At length all
8
became silent—the Moon disappeared  & ihme  young heroes had accomplished their plan in geting .into the camp of the Sciotans unperceived. They found them lying in a profound sleep—^for the fatigues of the day  &  revels of the night had bro't weariness upon them—& considering, when they lay down that the vigelence of their guards would secure them from surprise, they slept with unusial soundness—but +heir vigelence could not prevent an unspected destruction. The Tomehauks and swords of these daring youth, soon caused hundreds to sleep in eternal slumbers—& so anxious were they to finish the destruction of their enimies, that the day began to dawn before they had cleared themselves from their camp [0/  their enimies] —Scarce however had they past the last cen-tinal, & the alarm was given—The Sciotans beheld a most terrible slaughter, of their warriors & being fired with indignation sallied forth in parties in every direction—Kelsock & Hamkoo had nearly gained the encampment of the Kentucks . &  Haboon with a party of Sciotans had overtaken Hamko— Kelsock was so far in advance, that he was now safe from all danger—^but turning his eyes round he beheld Hakoon seize his friend, who was attempting to defend himself against the party—Kelsock turned instantly, and running furiously back cried. Spare 0 spare the youth, he is innocent—I alone contrived the slaughter of the Sciotaus—too much love to his friend induced him to join me in the enterprise—Here is 11% bosom—here take your revenge—Scarce had he spoken & Haboon plunged his sword into the Heart of Hamko.—The young hero fell—& with a groan expired—Kelsock instantly rushed upon Haboon & darted his sword thro' his heart— prostrate he tumbled at the feet of Hamkoo—but Kelsock could not long survive—a spear pierced him in the side—he cast his eyes on the lifeless Body of his friend and fell upon [his lifeless body]  it—he embraced it & never breathed again— Ah heroic youths,—in friendship ye lived—& in life & death you were joined.—
THE  "manuscript  FOUND."
Forty days had now expired since the two armies had taken their different positions—Eacll received large reinforcements which supplied the places of the slain. Experience had taught them to use stratigem instead of attacking under great disadvantages, & yet to remain long in their present situation could not possibly terminate the war successfully on the part of the Sciotans—Rambock considering the obsticles, which attended the prosicution of every plan, at last, by the advice of Sambal & Ulipoon, determined on a most rash & desperate enterprise—an enterprise which would in a measure saciate their revenge, provided that it should even produce the annihilation of their army.—As soon as darkness had overspread the earth at night—Rambock marched his whole army towards the City of Gamba—& such was the stillness of their movements that they were not perceived—nor was it known by Hamboon that they had marched until the morning light. —As soon as the Kentucks perceived that the Sciotans had abandoned the place of their encampment & found the direction they had gone, they immediately pursued them with the utmost expedition.—But too late to prevent the intended slaughter & devastation. The Sciotans without delaying their march by attacking any forts in their way, merely entered the vilages, killing the inhabitants who had not made their escape & burning their houses—Theyarived before the City of Gamba —Great indeed was the surprise, the consternation & terror of the Citizens—Many fled to the fort—A band of about three thousand resolute warriors sceized their arms, determined to risk their lives in the defence of the City. The leader of this band was Lamock the eldest son of Labanko—He inherited the virtues of his excellent Father, and even thirsted to avenge his death by sacrificing to his manes the blood of his cruel enimies. He posted his warriors in a narrow passage which led to the City.—The Sciotan Emperor immediately formed his plan of attack.—A large host selected from all the grand divisions of his army marched against them—^They were com-
manded by Moonrod—He led them against this gallant & desperate band of Kentudis, & made a most furious  &  violent charge upon them, But they were resisted with a boldness,* which will forever do honour to their emmortal valour.— Many hundreds of their Enimies they pierced with their deadly weapons & caused heaps of them to lie prostrate in the narrow passage.—Such prodigious havock was made on the Sciotans by this small band of valiant Citizens, who were driven to despiration  &.  whose only object was to sell their lives dear to their enimies, that even Moonrod began to de^air of forcing his march into the City thro' this narrow passage— Being informed by a treacherous Kentuck of another passage, he immedip-tely dispatched a party of about four thousand from his band to enter the City thro' tiiat passage & to fall upon the rear of the Kentucks.—This plan succeeded—These heroes now found the war to rage both in front & rear  &  part facing their new assailants they attacked them  [new assaiianUi] with incredible fury—What could they do? resistance was now in vain. They could no longer maintain the bloody contest against such a mighty host. Lamock then commanded the survivors of his little Band to break thro' the ranks of his last assailants  &  to retreat,  [to the fort']  It was impossible to withstand the violence of their charge—they broke thro' the ranks of their enimies <fe made a passage over the bodies* of heroes, thro' which they retreated  &  mai'ched to the fort— About seven hundred with their valiant leader thus made their escape,  [& ari/ved safe in the fori] —The remainder of the three thousand sold their lives in defence of their friends  & their country—This Battle checked the progress of the enimy which prevented an emence slaughter of citizensr—as the greatest part by this meaoa had. opportunity to gain  ihe  fort
As soon, as all resistance was over come  &  had subsided, the Sciotans lost  UQ  time—biit marched into the City and commenced a general, plunder of all articles which could conveniently transported.   Ulipoon, tho careful not to expose his
;per3an to the deadly weapons of an enimy—^was however very industrious in this part of the war—None discovered so much engagedness as himself to grasp the most valuable property in the city.—But expecting the Kentuck army to arive soon tlhey must accomplish their mischief with the utmost expedition— The City they sat on fire in various places—& then retired hack and encamped near the fort, intending on the next day, unless prevented by the arrival of Hamboon with his army, to storm the fort & massacre the whole multitude of citizens which were there collected.—Behold the conflagration of the City,—the flames in curls assend towards heaven—& as the darkness of the Night had now commenced—this added to the horror of the scene—The illumination spread far & wide & distant vilages beheld the redning light assend—^as a certain pioneir of their own conflagration, should the war continue to rage. But mark the sorrow & lamentation of the poor Citizens now incircled by the walls of a fort—Happy that they had escaped the intended massacre of a barberous unrelenting Enimy^—but indignant & sorrowful at beholding the ruins of all their property.—& & even filled with the greatest anxiety lest Hamboon should not arive in season to prevent the storm" ing of the fort.—But their anxiety soon vanished. When the shades of evening began to overspread the earth, Hamboon & his army had arrived within five miles of the City. They beheld the flames beginning to assend. The idea was instantly reallized that an indiscrimate slaughter had taken place.— [  What were the destraded outcries of the dwellers of the Oity.^^ FcUhers & mothers — Brothers & sisters, wives & children^  In addition to the distraction of all their property, they now had a reallizing anticipation of the massacre of their dearest friends & relation. Such was their anxiety to precipitate their march that it was scarcely in the power of their commander to retard their steps, so as to prevent them from breaking the order of their ranks. They made however the utmost expedition— determined if they found their enimy to take ample vengence
But when they arrived  &  found that the greatest part of the citizens were in the fort this afforded no small aleviation to their anxiety  &  grief—But their thirst for revenge  &  their ardent desire to engage the enimy in battle did not in the least abate.
Determined that the Sciotans should have no chance to improve the darkness of the ensuing night to make their escape—every preparation was made to attack them the next morning.—This was expected by the Sciotans, who were wishing for another opportunity to measure swords with the Ken-tucks.  &  as soon as the morning light appeared they marched a small distance to a hill &  [there]  the army paraded in proper order for battle.—Scarce had they finished their arangements when they beheld Ham^boon^s Army marching towards them —He halted within about half a mile of the Sciotans—& sent out a small party to reconoiter & discover their situation—In the mean time he ordered Hanock  [his son]  to march with twelve thousand men round the Sciotan Army & lie in ambush in their rear in order to surprise them with an attack after the battle should commence.
As the two armies were paraded in fair view of each other the expectation was that a most bloody engagement would take place immediately.—The cowardly mind of Ulipoon was not a little terrified when he beheld the number & martial appearance of the Enimy—But his inventive genius was not long at a loss for an expedient, which he immagined would extricate himself from all danger—He repairs to Hambock  & addressed him to this effect. May it please your majesty. During the first battle it was my misfortune to be prevented by sickness from being at the head of my brave warriors & displying my valour. It is my wish now to perform feats of heroism which shall place me on equal ground with the most valiant princes of your empire.—With your permission I will lead on my division  &  storm the fort of the Kentucks—This will fill their warriors with consternation & terror—You may
then obtain an easy victory— &  and destroy them with as much facility as you would so many porcupines.—Besides by attacking the fort at this time when they are not expecting such a manoever—the imperial family will be prevented from making their escape & I shall then be able to restore to your majesty your daughter Lamesa.—^The Emperor being pleased with the plan granted to Ulipoon his permission to carry it into eflfect.—Ulipoon did not wait a moment—But immediately returned back and commanded his forces, which consisted of about seventeen thousand to march—He was careful at the same time to see that they carried with thein all the plunder they had taken in the City of Gamba—& particularly that portion which had been set apart for himself.—But nothing was farther from the heart of Ulipoon than to fulfil his promise—He had no intention to risk his person in the hazardous attempt to storm, the fort—but his determination was to march with the utmost expedition to his own dominions & to carry with him his rich plunder.—Having marched towards the fort until they had got beyond the view of the Sciotan anny— he then ordered them to turn their course towards the great River—^to the place where the left their boats.—In this direction they had not proceeded far when they were seen by a number of pioneirs, whom Hanock had sent forward to make discoveries.—^As his band were not far distant they soon gave him the inteligence—He immediately dispach an express to Hamboon—^informing him that he should pursue them as their object probably was to ravage the country—& recommending not to attack the Sciotans until further information from him.—Hanocks devision were not discovered by Ulipoon—& of consequence he proceeded in his march without suspecting any anoiance from the Enimy, happy in the reflection that he had greatly enriched himself by a prodigious mass of plunder, & not in the least troubled about his fellow warriors, whom he had deserted on the eve of a most hazardous engagement.—Hanock pursued him, but
was careful not be discovered—^^WlieD the sun was nearly-down Ulipoon halted & encamped.—During the NightHanodk made his arangements—he formed his men into four Divisions & surrounded the Enimy. Their orders were as soon as the morning light began to appear, to rush into Ulipoon's encampment & to massecre his warriors without discremination. —The fatal moment had arived, & punctual jat the very-instant of time the attack was began on every part. & such was the surprise  &  terror which it produced that the Sciotans were thrown into the utmost confusion—& it was impossible for their officers to form them into any order to make defence —Every man at last attempted to make his escape—^but wherever they rushed forward in any direction they met the deadly spears of the Kentucks—It is impossible to discribe the horror of the bloody scene [A  even humanity recoils at beholding] Humanity—sympathy & compassion must- drop a tear at beholding the uproar & confusion, the distress & anguish, the blood & carnage of so many thousand brave warriors  [who was great misfortwne was to have a coward for their commander'] — who were reduced to their dreadful situation by the cowardise [&  nigardly]  & avaricious disposition of their Commander. But only three thousand made their escape. As for Ulipoon he was mortally wounded & laid prostrate on the field—After the slaughter was ended in passing over the  [Jield of]  the slain, Hanock beheld the illfated prince—an object truely pitiable to behold—In the agonies of death & wreathing under the most acute pain, he exclaimed. Alas my wretched situation—It was avarice, cursed avarice which induced me to engage in this horrid war—& now  \my]  the mischief and cruelties intended as the means to acquire wealth & agrandize-ment, are justly turned upon my own head—He spoke & deeply groaning, he breathed no more The galant Hanock droped a tear—& feeling no enmity towards the lifeless remains of those, who had been his \enimies, he ordered three hundred men to  \bury]  remain on the ground & commit their
bodies to the Dust—This says he is the will of him whose compassion is infinite. He then directed Como his dhief Captain to pursue the survivors of Ulipoon's army & to destroy them if possible.—^With the remainder of his troops, he returned, back to carry into effect the order of Hamboon. Como overtook & killed about a thousand of the wretched fugitives—the remainder escaped to their own land,—except about fifty who fled to the army of Rambock—& gave him the dreadful inteligence of Ulipoon's distraction.—
Great were the amazement & consternation of Rambock &  his whole army. They now beheld their situation to be extremely critical  &  dangerous & saw the necessity of the most vigorous & heroic exertions.. What says Rambock to his princes, is our wisest course to pursue? Sabamah, Ran-coff & Nunapon advised him to retreat without losing a moment, for say they, we have taken ample revenge for the crime Elseon.—^To effect this we have thrown ourselves into the heart of their country—have lost a large division of our army—& are so weakened by our losses that we are in the utmost danger of being defeated & even anihilated.—It must therefore be the height of folly & madness to prossecute the war any farther in this country.—But Sambal  &  the other princes condemned this plan as pusilanimous & disgraceful & proposed to steal a march on the Kentucks & to storm their 'fort before they should be apprised of their designs.—This last advice met the approbation of the Emperor. Nothing says he can save our army from destruction but the most daring atcheivments. That they might gain the fort without being perceived by the Kentucks. It was necessary that they should march some distance in the direction, where Hanock had emcamped, in order to cooperate with Hamboon, when he should commence the engagement—When the night had far advanced Rambock's forces were all in readiness & began their march for the fort. They proceeded about two miles—& a small party in advance, discovered Hanocks warriors—This
discovery produced an alteration in Rambock's plan—He directed Sambal to proceed against the fort—^whilst he, as soon as the light should appear, would attack Hanock—Sambal was highly pleased with this command—as a victory would ensure him the capture of Lamesa— &  afford him an opportunity to obtain revenge. He arived at the fort just as the blushing morn began to appear.— [Great indeed was the swr-prize which his arrival produced']—On  three sides he stationed small parties who were ordered to massacre all the citizens who should attempt to make their escape—With the main body of his army he made an assault upon the fort.—Amazement & terror seized the minds of the whole multitude of citizens;  [in the fort This enterprize of the Sdotans was unexpected — as they were]  were unprepared to defend the fort against such a formidable force. Lamock however placed himself at the head of about one thousand warriors & attempted to beat them back from the walls  &  prevent their making a breach. But it was imposible with his small band to withstand the strength of such a mighty army—They broke down part of the palasadoes & entered the fort thro' the break— &  immediately began the massacre of the defenceless multitude without regard to age or sex—Sambal being anxious to find Lamesa rushed forward with a small band & surrounded a  [small'] block house—He then broke down the door & entered—Here he beheld all the Ladies of the imperial family  &  many other Ladies of distinction—He instantly sprang towards Lamesa in order to seize her—but was prevented by Heliza who steped between them & falling upon her knees implored him to spare the life of Lamesa—Scarce had she spoken when the cruel monster buried his sword in her bosom & she fell lifeless before the eyes of her dearest friend—Lamesa gave a scream, &  looking fiercely on Sambal she exclaimed. Thou monster of vilany & cruelty, could nothing saciate your revenge but the death of my dear friend,—the amiable, the innocent Heliza   Here is my heart—I am prepared for your next vie-
tiin. Ah no, says Sambal, your life is safe from my sword. I shall conduct you to my palace  &  you shall be honored with me for your partner. Insult me not, says she, thou malicious bloody villain—either kill me or be gone from my sight—my eyes can never indure the man who is guilty of such monstrous crimes.—Set your heart at rest says he my dear Lamesa—I will convince you that I am a better man than your beloved Elseon—^his head shall, soon saciate my revenge  &  then you shall be the Queen of Sciota.—^At this Instant a loud voice was heard—^The Kentucks are marching with a prodigious army towards the fort.—Sambal turning to his warriors present ordered them to guard the women in that house & not permit any of them to escape—for says he I must go and destroy that army of Kentucks. Great already had been the slaughter which the Sciotans had made of the citizens in the fort—Those who had attempted to escape thro' a gate which was thrown open were met  &  massacred by the Sciotan warriors on the outside—But their progress was arested by the appearance of Elseon at the head of thirty thousand warriors —They had marched with the greatest speed—^for they were informed by an express that the Sciotans had invested the Fort. When Sambal beheld them he instantly concluded to draw his army out of the fort & try a battle with them in the open field.—His orders were immediately spread thro' every part of the fort where his men were employed in killing the defenceless, & in fighting Hemocks little band of desperate heroes  [whom Hanock commanded']. —The Sciotans were* soon formed  &  marched out of the fort & paraded in proper order for battle.—Elseon observing this, commanded his men to halt, & made his arangements to rush forward and commence the attack—Having brandished his sword as a token for silence he thus spoke.

Not a moment, when his warriors were stimulated for the Combat did Elseon tarry—but marched with pricipi-tation prepared to make a most furious charge. Sambal was ready to meet him—& marched forward with equal boldness & celerity. The charge was tremendous. Not the dashing itgainst each other of two mighty ships, in a hurricane up(«i the  \b(yisterous\  ocean, could have been more terrible. Each warrior, fearless of danger, met his antagonist determined to destroy his life or loose his own in the contest—The battle extended thro' every part of both armies—As warriors fell in the front ranks, their places were supplied from the rear—& reserved Bands rushing between the divisions were met by others of equal strength & valour.—Helicon the intimate friend of Elseon beheld Sambal—who was encouraging his "Warriors to fight bravely, as no other alternative remained for them but victory or death.—When Helicon beheld him his youthful mind felt the impulse of ambition—he sprang towards Sambal & changeled him to the Combat. Sambal -gave him no time to repeat the chalenge, but rushed upon him, with more fury than a tiger  &  with his sword he struck Helicon's head from his body—Thus  fell   the  brave, the
amiable youth whose thirst for glory impaled him to attempt: an, exploit too rash & daring—Warriors fell on every side & the field was covered with dead & dying heroes—^A messenger ran & told Elseon of the fate of Helion who commanded the left wing of his army & that Sambal had broken their ranks &  was making indisribable havock of his warriors—^What intelligence could have been, more shocking?   Elseon could not refrain from tears for a moment-*-Ah Helicon says he, thou hast been more dear to me than a brother*—Heaven demandg that I should; revenge thy cruel death.   He instantly selected a small.bajid & marched,with the utmost speed to the leftt wing of his army*-^He rallied; hi& retreating warriors <fe eaigagedsin the conflict with tenfold fury:—Soon he beheldithe mighty Sambal, whose sword was crimsoned, with the blood' of his^friend; & Sambal cast his ey^ upon him & as he beheid him. his malice instantly, inkindled into such a furious flamey that. [Aw  reason fled for amomeni  A] he raved like a madman. —Both heroes sprang towards, each others—Their warriors/ beheld them  &  being mutually inspired with the sam^ sentiments the respective bands retired back & left the two indignant Champions in the space between.^—Ah exclaimed Sambal Robber & perfiduous scoundrel, after seducing the Emperor daughter who was my wife  &  transporting her from our: dominions, have you the temerity to meet my conquering sword.   This sword which has piercedi Labano.   & cut off the head of Helicon & which has destroyed^hundreds more mighty thau yourself—shall be plunged into your cowardly heart— &, your head shall be carried in triumph into the city of Talanga —^ there it shall be pres^red as a trophy of my superior; strength & valour.
Vain Boaster--sayfl Elseon—I regoice to meet you. The Benevolent Being will now terminate your carere of bloody crimes-^This sword shall pierce your malignant heart &,cut of! that head^ which, has ploted.the. ruin of my country— Saanbal eager for revenge, could hear no moie^   He sprang
forward  &  aimed a thrust of his sword at Elseon's Heart but Elseon turned the point of his sword from him with his own —& then darted his sword into his left arm which caused the blood to gush forth—Sambal was now more indignant than ever— &  raising his sword he threw his whole strength into one mighty effort, with an intention to divide his body in twain. But Elseon, quick as the Lightning sprang back & Sambals sword struck the ground with a prodigious force which broke in the middle—He himself had nearly tumbled his whole length—but recovering  &  beholding his defenceless situation, he ran a small distance, & seizing a stone sufficiently big for a common man to lift he threw it at Elseon—It flew with great velocity & had not Elseon bowed his head his brains must have quited their habitation—his Cap however was not so fortunate; haveng met the stone as he bowed it was carried some distance from him  &  lodged on the ground. Elseon regardless of his cap, ran swiftly upon Sambal, whose feet having sliped when he threw the stone had fallen upon his back & had not recovered—Terror now seized his mind— Spare, 0 spare my life says he & I will restore peace to Ken-tuck  &  you may enjoy Lamesa.—No peace sais Elseon do I desire with a man, whose sword is red with the blood of my friends He spoke  &  plunged his sword into Sambals heart.—
The Sciotans beheld the heage body of their King pale & lifeless—Consternation & terror seized their minds They fled in dismay & confusion—Elseon pursued them with his warriors  &  overthrew & killed thousands in the pursuit—About two thousand made good their escape—& carried the doleful tidings of Sambals death & the emence slaughter of his army to their own Land. And indeed their escape was owing to the great anxiety of Elseon & his warriors to visit their friends in the fort & to ascertain the extent of the massacre that Sambal  &  his army had made.—After pursuing the Sciotans about six miles Elseon  &  his army returned in great haste  &  entered
the fort.—Great, inexpressably great was the joy of the Citizens when they beheld them returning with the laurels of victory &  when they were informed of the destruction of so many thousand of their enimies.—But as great was their grief & lamentation, when they beheld & reflected on the vast number of citizens & of Elseon's warriors, who had fallen by the sword of the Sciotans.    No death produced such universal regret & sorrow as those of Helicon  &  Heliza.   The one was the intimate friend of Elseon & the other of Lamesa.—^They both possessed hearts which were formed for the most ardent friendship & love.—Their acquaintance produced the most sincere attachment—They exchanged vows of perpetual fidelity &  love to each other—& only waited for the termination of the war to fulfil their mutual engagement to unite their hands in wedlock—But this pleasant anticipation of conjugal felicity was destroyed by the cruel sword of Sambal—Naught availed the innocence & the amiable accomplishments of the fair Heliza?   She must fall a victim to saciate the revenge of a barbarous Tyrant—^Had Helicon known when he attacked the savage monster that he had assassinated his beloved Heliza, it would have inspired him with the most ardent desire for revenge  &  added vigor to his arm & keeness to his sword.— [Ah said]  A Kentucky Bard represented the erial form of Heliza as ariving on the celestial plain— &  being told that she must wait a short time—& Helicon would ascend to conduct her as his partner to a delightful Bower which was surrounded by the most beautiful flowers  &  delicious fruits—& where the singing of musical birds would charm them with their melody. —When Elseon had entered the fort, he found that Lamock with the survivors of his little band of warriors had made prisoners, of the Sciotans whom Sambal had left to guard the imperial Ladies—& that these Sciotans had done them no injury nor even insulted them with words—Says Elseon for this honourable treatment of my friends I will shew these enimies compassion—Go says he to them, return in peace to
your own land—& tell your friends that Elseon will not hurt an Enimy, who has done him a favour.
The time of Elseon was precious—^He spent but a few moments with Lamesa, in which they exchanged mutual congratulations—& expressions of the most tender & sincere affection.—She conjured him to spare the life of her father & brother & not to expose his own life any farther than his honour & the interest of his country required. I shall cheerfully says he comply with every request, which will promote your happiness.   He embraced her <fe bid her adtie.—
As the situation of Hamboon's army might require his immediate return, he lost no time to regulate matters in the fort—^but leaving five thousand men to bury the dead, & defend the citizens, he marched with the remainder, which consisted of about twenty thousand, towards Hamboons encampment.—
When Sambal marched with his division against the fort it was Rambock's intention to have attacked Hanock the next morning—but perceiving that Hamboon had been apprised of his movement, & was then within a small distance ready to CO operate with Hanocks division, Rambock altered his plan &  determined to wait for the return of Sambal. As for Ham-boon he concluded to wait until Elseon's return.—These determinations of the hostile Emperors, prevented, in this intervail of time, any engagement between the two grand armies.—But when the fate of Sambal's division was decided—& Elseon had returned with the joyful news of his victory, the Kentucks were all anxious for an immediate Battle.
